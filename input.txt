Today, our class has a lunch contest. First, we look at the sandwiches. Tom’s sandwich is big, and it’s as big as Mike’s. Both are very big! Next, we look at the salads and fruit. Sally’s salad has many colors. It’s as colorful as Anna’s fruit bowl. Anna’s fruit is also very colorful. Ken has soup. It’s very hot. His soup is as hot as a cup of tea. Then, we start eating. Tom eats his sandwich as fast as Mike. Sally eats her salad slowly. She eats as slowly as Anna. After we all finish, we decide on the winner. We all agree. Every lunch is a winner!
