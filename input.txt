Many things are used in our everyday lives.
For example, coffee is made in many homes each morning.
English is spoken in many countries around the world.
In my city, there are many old buildings.
They were built a long time ago.
I ride my bike to school every day.
Sometimes, dinner is cooked by my dad.
On weekends, food is often bought at the supermarket.
