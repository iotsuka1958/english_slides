00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey everyone, welcome. You know, there's
this one English puzzle that trips up
everyone when they're learning.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,240
Even little kids in America. It's all
about comparing things and today we're
going to crack the code together.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,000
You ready? All right, let's get right to
it. Take a look at this sentence on your
screen.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Health is importanter than money. Does
that sound a little weird to you?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Like something's just not right?
Importanter. That word definitely feels
like an imposter.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
So, what is going on here? And you know
what?

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,560
Your brain is totally right. That word is
wrong.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,160
And that brings us to the big mystery for
today.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,480
When do we use ER and when do we need
something else?

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,880
Let's figure this out.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,360
Okay, so this slide right here gives us
our first major clue.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
Over on the left, you've got your short
words.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
You know these guys, tall, big, wide.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,640
You just add ER, taller, bigger, easy
peasy, but then look at the right.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,040
These are the final bosses of the video
game, right?

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,200
Important, difficult, beautiful.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,040
Trying to add ER to them just doesn't
work.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,160
So we need a new superpower. And that
superpower, well, the key,

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,680
the secret password to solving this whole
thing,

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
it's all about how long the word is. Yep,
for these longer words,

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,780
trying to add ER is just not gonna happen.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,040
But don't worry, we've got something way,
way cooler.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
It's like a secret magic spell. And here
they are.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,240
The magic words are more and most. That's
it, that's the secret.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,200
You don't change the long word at all.
Nope, don't touch it.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,640
You just put one of these special words
right in front of it.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,480
How simple is that? So how do we use these
magic words?

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,980
Well, it's super easy.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,280
If you're comparing just two things, you
use more.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,400
So remember our weird sentence from the
beginning? We can fix it now.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,960
Health is more important than money. See,
perfect.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,320
And what if you're comparing like three or
more things

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
and one is the absolute number one, then
you use the most.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
Health is the most important thing. Boom,
mystery solved.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,040
Okay, let's practice with some real life
examples.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,560
I think we can all agree on this one,
right?

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
For many students, video games

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,000
are more interesting than homework, no
debate there.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Or how about movies?

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,640
This action movie is more exciting than
that drama.

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,920
And when we talk about music,

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,160
we always wanna know who is the most
famous singer

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,000
in America right now. See how it works?
It's everywhere.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,680
Just look at this table. Once you see the
pattern, you can't unsee it.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,240
Beautiful, more beautiful, the most
beautiful.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Difficult, more difficult, the most
difficult.

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,320
The main word stays exactly the same.

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,840
It's a fantastic, super reliable rule.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,240
All right, you've totally mastered the
main level,

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,120
so are you ready for a secret bonus round?

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Let's talk about a special group of words,
the LI words.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
And guess what?

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,400
The best news is, you don't really have to
learn a new rule.

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,680
For most words that end in LI, you just
use our magic words again.

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Like Bob spoke more slowly than Jane.

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,840
Or maybe your teacher in a quiet library
might say, please speak more quietly.

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
It just works.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,440
But wait, just when you think it's all
perfectly simple, English loves to throw
in a surprise,

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
right? Always one little exception that
just loves to break the rules.

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,340
And that rule breaker is the word early.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,020
So even though it ends in L-Y, it pretends
it's a short word.

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,000
We don't say more early, no way.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,920
We say Jennifer got up earlier than Emily.

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,320
And the person who gets up first gets up
the earliest.

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,520
This is a big one to remember, so lock it
in your brain.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,800
Okay team, you've collected all the clues,
you've solved the puzzles, let's do a
quick

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,440
recap of everything we learned, and then
I've got one final challenge for you.

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,680
You totally did it! You cracked the code!
So let's review.

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Short words add er or est, easy.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Long words use our magic words more and
the most.

71
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Words ending in Y, they usually use more
and the most too.

72
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,760
And what was that one tricky exception?

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,760
That's right, early becomes earlier and
the earliest.

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
You guys are pros at this now.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,800
All right, here it is, your final
challenge.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
I want you to use what you just learned,
so think for a second.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,480
What is the most beautiful place in the
whole world for you?

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,080
Maybe it's a famous landmark, or maybe
it's just your favorite park.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,960
Try to answer that question out loud in a
full English sentence.

80
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,360
You've totally got this. Awesome work
today, everyone.

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll see you next time.
