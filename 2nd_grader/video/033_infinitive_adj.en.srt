1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
You know how English has these little
patterns

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,040
that you just use every single day
perfectly

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,560
without even thinking about it?

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,560
Well, today we're gonna pull back the
curtain

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,440
on one of those secret rules you've
already mastered.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,840
It's a bit of a mystery really,

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,280
a secret that's been hiding in plain sight
this whole time.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,320
So let's start with a little puzzle.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm about to show you a few sentences

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
and they're probably gonna sound totally
normal to you,

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,000
but I want you to look closely.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Okay, first step, I want something to
drink.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,700
Sounds pretty simple, right? And then
there's this one.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,420
He doesn't have time to read books. And
one more for good measure?

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,100
I need someone to help me. All right, so
what's the connection here?

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,020
What's the hidden pattern that little
grammar engine

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,860
running in the background of all three of
those sentences?

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
Take a quick look at them again, see if
you can spot it.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,820
Okay, you ready for the big reveal?

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,340
The secret is something I like to call the
to-do adjective.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,280
And now let's break down exactly what that
means.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,320
So let's go back to those sentences.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,480
See, in every single one we have a noun,

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,000
you know, something, time, someone,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,160
and right after it there's a phrase that
tells us more about it.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,840
What kind of something? Something to
drink. What kind of time?

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,440
Time to read. And what kind of someone?
Yup, someone to help.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,560
That little two plus verb phrase,

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,040
it's doing the exact same job as an
adjective.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,160
It's describing the noun that comes right
before it.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,720
And believe it or not, this pattern has a
fancy official name.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,080
the adjectival to infinitive.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,920
But really, don't let the name scare you.

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
It's just a technical way of saying

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,080
we're using that two plus a verb combo

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,580
to describe a noun, usually to give it a
purpose

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,120
or show an action it's meant for.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,860
So that two plus a verb thing we've been
talking about,

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,240
it's called an infinitive. And what's
really cool is that it's one

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,840
of the most flexible tools we have in
English.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,640
It can actually wear a few different hats

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,600
depending on the job it needs to do.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,340
For example, it can act like a noun,

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,900
Like when you say, to travel is my dream,

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,500
or it can be an adverb, like he ran to
catch the bus.

46
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,940
But today, we're all about its coolest
job,

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,460
the one you've already got down, wearing
that adjective hat,

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,220
where it describes a noun, just like in
our example,

49
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,220
I need something to drink.

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,300
Okay, so you've seen the theory, you get
the idea.

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Now it's time for a little challenge.

52
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,940
Let's see if you can put the pieces
together yourself.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,300
All right, first one up, the words are
help,

54
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,860
Many friends, two and him.

55
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,780
How do you unscramble those to make a
sentence?

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,420
Go ahead, take a second.

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,700
And the answer is, he has many friends to
help him. See that?

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,300
You've got your noun, many friends.

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,980
And right after it comes the infinitive to
help,

60
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,900
telling you exactly what those friends are
for. Perfect.

61
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,300
Okay, ready for another one? Let's go.

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,980
The words are to, do, and things.

63
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,460
And the sentence starts with, she has a
lot of. How do you finish it?

64
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,300
You got it. She has a lot of things to do
today.

65
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,460
There's our noun phrase, a lot of things,

66
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
and bam, right after it is the purpose, to
do.

67
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,420
It's so clean, so efficient.

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,380
And I bet you say something like this all
the time.

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,540
All right, last one in our little
challenge.

70
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,660
The words are places, see, many, and to.

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,140
The sentence starts, there are, and it
ends with, in New York.

72
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,740
You know what to do? And there it is.

73
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,340
There are many places to see in New York.

74
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,420
The noun is many places, and that little
phrase, to see, tells us exactly what
those places

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,980
are for. It's a perfect description. See?
You're natural at this.

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,460
So there you have it.

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,180
This isn't just some boring, dusty rule
from a grammar book.

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,940
It's a real communication tool, a genuine
grammar superpower that you've been using

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,860
this whole time.

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,820
So if there's one thing to take away from
all this, it's that the adjectival
infinitive

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,140
is pretty much the easiest, most direct
way in English to give a noun a purpose.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,980
It's the difference between just saying a
book and saying a book to read.

83
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,260
It's not just a decision, it's a decision
to make.

84
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,140
It's this incredibly elegant and powerful
tool that, it turns out, you've been using
all along.

85
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,980
And, well, that kind of makes you wonder,
doesn't it?

86
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,900
You've been using this supposedly complex
structure perfectly your entire life

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,980
without ever needing to know its fancy
name.

88
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,780
So, what are their amazing grammar rules
are you already a master of, just waiting
to be discovered?
