1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey everyone and welcome. Are you ready to
unlock a brand new English superpower?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,760
Well today that's exactly what we're going
to do.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,240
We're learning how to compare things and
trust me it's one of the most useful
skills you can

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,520
have. So let's jump right in. So why do I
call this a superpower?

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,200
Because it lets you express so many more
ideas. Suddenly you can talk about what's
bigger,

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,160
what's faster, or what's stronger. It is a
total game changer for your English.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's get started.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
All right, let's kick things off with a
little puzzle.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
Look at the sentence, Peter is younger
than George.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,200
We're obviously comparing Peter and
George, right?

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,360
So can you spot the secret code?

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160
What's the special word here that lets us
do the comparing?

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
I'll give you a hint. It's a word that
ends in ER.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
If you guessed younger, you are absolutely
right.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
And just like that, you found the main
rule

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
for comparing things in English. For most
short describing words,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
we call those adjectives, all you have to
do is add er to the end.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
That's it. Pretty cool, huh? Let's see how
this works.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,880
So this grammar has a name, of course.
It's called the comparative form.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,600
And all that means is it's the special
form we use to say that one thing

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
is more of something than another thing.
You're always, always comparing

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,440
two things. Now to make this super easy to
remember,

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,560
let's build what I like to call the magic
formula.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
This is the basic recipe for almost any
comparison sentence you'll ever make.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
First up, you start with the first thing
you're comparing. We'll just call it A.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,120
And here comes the magic part. Right after
A, you take your describing word, your
adjective,

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,280
and you add our secret code, R. So a word
like tall becomes taller. Small becomes
smaller.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,360
See? Simple, right? Okay. To finish our
magic formula, we just add the second
thing,

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,240
which we'll call b. But, and this is super
important, you have to connect them with
the word then.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,400
So many people forget this little word, so
please always remember then. So the whole
thing is,

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,120
a is adjective er, then b. Like, an
elephant is bigger than a mouse. Perfect.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Let's look at a few more quick examples of
this rule. Long becomes longer. Small
becomes

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Smaller. Tall becomes taller and young
becomes younger.

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,880
See, you're totally getting the hang of
this already.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Okay, you've totally mastered the basic
rule.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
You ready to level up? Because now we're
going to get into some pro tips for
spelling.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't worry, these are just a few little
tricks that are going to make your English

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,680
look and sound absolutely perfect. We've
got three pro tips coming your way.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,960
First, what do you do if a word already
ends with an E?

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,920
Second, there's a special rule for words
that end in Y.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
And third, we have the double-letter rule.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Let's break them down one by one.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,400
Our first pro tip is probably the easiest
one.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,880
If an adjective already ends in the letter
E,

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,800
like large or nice, you don't need to add
er, you just add the R.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,280
So large becomes larger and nice becomes
nicer. Simple as that.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Okay, pro tip number two is all about
words

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,320
that end in Y, like easy or heavy.

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
For these words, the Y kind of gets a
little shy.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,240
It changes into an I before you add the
ER.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,240
So easy becomes easier, heavy becomes
heavier.

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,620
This rule is super common, so it's a
really good one to remember.

53
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,740
And our final pro tip. This one is for
short words like big or hot.

54
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,960
You know, the ones that end with one vowel
and one consonant.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,120
For these, we give that last letter a
twin.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
We double it before we add er. So big
becomes bigger with two Gs.

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,100
and hot becomes hotter with two Ts.

58
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,580
It's a little tricky, but you'll get it in
no time.

59
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,380
So you've learned the main rule,

60
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,140
you've learned the pro tips, I think
you're ready.

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,460
It is challenge time. I'm gonna give you a
sentence with a blank

62
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,260
and you've gotta fill it in with the right
comparative form.

63
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,780
You ready? Let's do this. Okay, here's
your first question.

64
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,640
Tokyo is blank than New York. The word you
need to change is large.

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,340
So what do you do with it? Think back to
those pro tips.

66
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,860
And the answer is larger.

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,340
Because large ends in that E, you just add
an R. Excellent.

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,460
If you got that right, you're off to an
amazing start.

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,680
All right, challenge number two. George
got up, blank, then patty.

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,940
The word this time is early. Hmm, it ends
in Y.

71
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,740
What was that pro tip again? And the
answer is earlier.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,100
You change that Y to an I and then add er.
Fantastic.

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,180
You are really getting the hang of these
rules. Awesome work.

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,140
Okay, last one. You can do it. The coffee
was blank, then the tea.

75
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,340
Your word is hot. Remember that final pro
tip, the double letter rule.

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,460
What do you need to do here?

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,940
And the correct answer is hotter with two
teas.

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,940
You remember to double that last letter
before adding ER? Perfect.

79
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,420
You completely aced the challenge. Amazing
job.

80
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,620
So let's just take a moment to realize

81
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,540
how this one new skill makes your English
so much stronger.

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,100
You've learned a ton today, and this is
gonna make your speaking and

83
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,220
your writing way more interesting and
powerful.

84
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,540
So let's do a quick recap. First, remember
the magic formula.

85
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,860
A is something er, then b. The main rule,
just add er.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,500
Then are pro tips. If it ends in e, just
add r.

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,300
If it ends in y, change it to i-e-r.

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,780
And for those short words like big or hot,
you double that last letter.

89
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,500
That's the whole shebang. And that is it.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,120
Just like that, your English is already
smarter

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,540
and stronger than it was a few minutes
ago.

92
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,140
Keep practicing, keep comparing things
around you,

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,700
and keep up the great work. You're doing
an awesome job.

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,740
See you next time.
