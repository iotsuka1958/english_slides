00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Today, we're going to talk about one of
the smallest, but honestly, one of the
mightiest

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,360
words in the entire English language. It's
just two letters, I-F.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,940
But believe it or not, this tiny word
shapes conditions, it opens up
possibilities, and

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,480
it defines outcomes. So let's dive in and
see how IF really works.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,080
Let's start with a sentence we've all
heard a million times.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,100
You will succeed if you work hard. It's
pretty straightforward, right?

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,880
You've got a condition, working hard, and
you've got a result, succeeding.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,680
It's clear, it's direct, no confusion
there.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,820
But here's the big question for today.
What happens if we just flip it? Does
changing the

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,000
order of the words change what it means?
Or maybe does it change the impact? This
one simple question

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,040
is going to unlock a really fundamental
rule of English grammar. Okay, so to
really get a handle

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,160
on if, we first need to look at what its
actual job is inside a sentence. So
grammatically speaking,

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,720
if kicks off what we call a clause, you
know, just a little mini idea with a
subject and a verb.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,280
Its whole purpose is to set a condition.
Just think of it as a substitute for the
phrase

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,420
on the condition that. So if you work hard
is just a shorter, punchier way of saying

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,680
on the condition that you work hard. So
now we know what if does. But here's

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,440
where it gets interesting. Turns out there
isn't just one right way to build these
kinds of

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,800
sentences. Nope. There are two. And here
they are, side by side. Now, the most
important thing

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,060
to notice here is that the meaning is
exactly the same. In pattern one, the main
idea, you will

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,340
succeed, comes first. In pattern two, the
condition, if you work hard, comes first.
Same ingredients,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,960
just a different recipe. But while the
meaning is identical, there's one tiny,
and I mean absolutely

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,620
critical difference in the punctuation.
This is probably the most common mistake
people make,

23
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,240
but it's so, so easy to fix once you see
it.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
And here it is, the big secret.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,500
When the if clause starts the sentence,
you need a comma.

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,360
It's like a little speed bump,

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
a tiny pause that separates the condition
from the result.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,260
If you work hard, you will succeed.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,680
But if the if part comes at the end, you
don't need it.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,760
It's as simple as that. All right,
theory's over.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,020
Now it's time to put what you've learned
into practice.

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,940
I'm gonna throw a few jumbled up sentences
on the screen

33
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,320
and I want you to try and unscramble them
in your head.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,360
You ready for this? Let's go. Okay, first
one up.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
The main result is you will feel better.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,760
The condition is all jumbled up in the
parentheses.

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,580
How would you put that together? Did you
get it?

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,380
The answer is, if you drink water, you
will feel better.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,300
And because we started with if, we
absolutely need that comma.

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
Let's try another one with the same
structure.

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,780
Okay, here the result is, you will have
fun.

42
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,520
Go ahead and see if you can unscramble
that condition.

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,900
And this one becomes, if you play soccer,
you will have fun.

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
See the pattern emerging?

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,800
Okay, one more like this, just to really
lock it in.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,980
The result is, you're going to learn a
lot.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,020
The condition has to do with reading
books. How does it go?

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,820
And the answer is, if you read books, you
will learn a lot. Perfect.

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,100
Notice in all three of those, if came
first,

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,960
which meant the comma was doing the
important work of separating the two
ideas.

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,220
All right, switch gears now.

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,920
Pay close attention to this one because
the structure is a little different.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,660
The main idea is already there for you. We
will watch a movie.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,340
Now, how do you tack on the condition?
Exactly.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,240
We will watch a movie if it rains.

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,540
This time, we're using that other pattern.

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,760
The if clause is at the end, which means
what's missing. That's right.

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,620
No comma necessary. All right, last one.
The grand finale.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,360
We're starting with the main subject.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,480
we. The rest is a bit of a mess. Put all
those pieces together to make a sentence
that makes

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,820
sense. And you got it. We will be happy if
you smile. This uses our first pattern. So
the if

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:05,320
is at the end and we don't need a comma.
Fantastic job. Okay. So you've seen the
patterns. You've put

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,740
them into practice, but now it's time for
the final aha moment. The simple reason
why this

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,280
whole comma rule even exists in the first
place. So let's do a super quick recap of
what we figured

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,060
out. Number one, if just sets up a
condition. Number two, that condition can
go at the beginning

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,860
or at the end of the sentence. And number
three, the big one, you only use a comma
when if is the

67
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,040
very first word. And all of this leads to
the big secret. If is a special kind of
word called a

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,600
conjunction. Its whole purpose in life is
to connect ideas. In our sentence, it
connects

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,300
you will succeed with your card. Now think
of if like a piece of tape. When the tape
is in the

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,280
middle, it holds the two pieces of paper
together perfectly. But if you move that
piece of tape to

71
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,620
the very beginning, you need something
else to show where one piece of paper ends
and the next

72
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,460
one begins. And that's the commas job. So
we end right where we started, but now
you've got a whole

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,340
new perspective. You will succeed if you
work hard versus if you work hard, you
will succeed.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
Grammatically, they're identical.

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,640
But rhetorically, which one feels more
powerful?

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Which one lands with a bigger punch for
you?

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,640
Now that is the art that lives just beyond
the rules.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,380
Something to think about.
