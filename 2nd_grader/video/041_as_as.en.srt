1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey there! Have you ever noticed how we
just can't stop comparing things?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,400
Like, is one phone faster than another
one?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,320
Or was the movie as good as the book?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
Well, today we're going to unlock a super
simple English phrase

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,840
that lets you make all those comparisons
perfectly. As, as, as!

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
So here's what we'll be diving into.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,440
First, why we're basically wired to
compare things.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
Then, the main tool for when things are
equal.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,400
After that, what to do when they're not
equal.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Then we'll get some practice in

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,200
and we'll finish up by talking about your
new comparison superpower.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Alright, first up, the comparison
compulsion.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
This sounds a little dramatic, but really,

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,480
why do our brains always seem to be
measuring one thing against another?

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
Just think about it for a second.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,160
You're doing this all day long, probably
without even noticing.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,880
From the piece of cake you get to the
video games you play,

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,160
you're constantly checking how one thing
stacks up against another.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
It's just what we do. And you know what,
it's totally normal.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,160
it's actually one of the main ways our
brains make sense of everything around us.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,880
It helps us figure out what's what, make
choices,

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,120
and just understand our world a little bit
better.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
But here's the catch. For a comparison to
actually work,

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
you have to be measuring the same thing.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
So we can compare John's weight to Emily's
weight. Sure, no problem.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
But comparing John's weight to Emily's
height?

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,160
That doesn't really make sense, does it?

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
You have to compare apples to apples, or
in this case, weight to weight.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
So, when we have a fair comparison, how do
we say it in English?

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,620
Well, that brings us to the star of
today's show, the super-useful phrase, as-
as.

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,040
Look how easy this is.

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,860
You can start with a simple fact, right,
like, John is tall.

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,240
But if we want to compare him to his
brother who's the same height, we just pop
in our

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,840
magic phrase and it becomes, John is as
tall as his brother. See?

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,400
Simple. Here's the formula, which is
super, super simple.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,600
You've got item A, then as, then a
describing word,

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,880
then as again, and finally, item B.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Whenever you see this, it's a signal that
A equals B

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,760
in that specific way. And what's really
cool is how flexible this is.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,560
It works with adjectives, words that
describe things

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,320
like tall, and it also works with adverbs,

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,640
words that describe actions, like fast.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,480
For example, Jennifer runs as fast as
Emily.

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,280
The pattern stays exactly the same, so
useful.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,960
But okay, let's be real. In life, most
things aren't exactly the same.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
So how do we talk about that?

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,200
All we have to do is learn the negative
version.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Let's take an example. Tokyo Tower is
really, really tall,

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
but Tokyo Sky Tree is even taller.

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
So to show that difference, we can say,

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
Tokyo Tower is not as high as Tokyo Sky
Tree.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,840
That makes it totally clear they aren't
equal.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,920
The formula is almost the same.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,600
We just add one little word, not, right
before the first as.

55
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,900
This structure always means that the first
thing, item A,

56
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,600
is less than item B in that quality we're
talking about.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,360
So, Tokyo Tower is less high than Tokyo
Sky Tree. Makes sense, right?

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,020
And hey, here's a little bonus tip for ya.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,480
In these negative sentences,

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,800
you can also swap out the first as for the
word so.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,200
You could say, Tokyo Tower is not so high
as Tokyo Sky Tree.

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,360
It means the exact same thing. Pretty
cool.

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,760
Okay, enough with the theory. The best way
to make this stuff stick

64
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,560
is to actually use it. So let's try
building a few sentences together.

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,200
You ready? All right, here's your first
challenge.

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Take a look at the words in the
parentheses.

67
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,960
How would you put them in the right order
to make the sentence work?

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Go on, take a second to think it through.
Yes, that's it.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,960
As popular as. This tells us that both
sports

70
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,840
are at the same level of popularity.
Awesome job.

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Okay, ready for round two? This time it's
a negative one

72
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,520
and you've got four words to put in order.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Think back to that formula we just talked
about. What do you think?

74
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
How does this one fit together? You got
it.

75
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,760
Not as busy as this clearly means that
Peter is the one who's busier.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,080
You are definitely getting the hang of
this nicely done.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,940
Okay, let's bring it all home now.

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,280
We'll do a quick summary to make sure

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,680
you've got this new comparison superpower
locked in.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,560
So, here's your quick guide all in one
spot.

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,280
When things are equal, it's as, as.

82
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,980
When things are unequal, where A is less
than B,

83
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,640
you just use not as, as.

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,900
And remember, you can also use not so as
if you want.

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,400
It's really that simple. These two little
patterns

86
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,620
are gonna help you make all sorts of
comparisons.

87
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,240
So what does this all mean? It means you
now have this fantastic tool

88
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,580
to explain exactly how two things relate
to each other.

89
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,320
It might seem small, but trust me,

90
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,680
it's a huge part of speaking English
clearly and with confidence.

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,820
So, I'll leave you with a little challenge
to practice.

92
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,860
Using this new structure, what's something
you can think of

93
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,040
that is as interesting as a good book?
Give it some thought.

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,840
Thanks so much for joining me today.
