00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey everyone, welcome. Today we're going
to unlock a real superpower in your
English.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,440
It's a word you already use, but we're
going to totally master it.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,160
Ready to make your English sound awesome?
Let's get right into it.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
Okay, let's kick things off with a super
simple question.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,280
Why was she happy? I mean, think about it.
We ask why all the time, right? Like,

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,040
why is the sky blue? Or maybe more
importantly, why is pizza so incredibly
delicious?

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
Why is all about finding the reason?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,000
And boom, here's the answer. She was
happy. Because she passed the exam. See
that word?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,120
Because? That's our magic key for today.
It's like a bridge, you know? It connects
the result,

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,760
she's happy, with the reason she passed
her exam. So let's officially introduce
the star of our show,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,400
the word because. Its job is super, super
simple. It just explains the reason why.
For my friends

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,960
who speak Japanese, it's a lot like using
say or none of that. Honestly, it's one of
the

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,040
the most powerful tools you have for
explaining, well, pretty much anything.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,200
All right, so how do we actually use this
superpower?

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,020
Let's start with the basic formula.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,880
Think of this as level one, your first
most important step to becoming a total
pro at

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,120
explaining why.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,800
And hey, this formula is so easy to
remember, it just goes like this.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,400
First you give the result, then you drop
in our magic word because, and finally

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
you give the reason.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,000
result because reason. Easy peasy right?
Let's see this thing in action. Check out

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
this sentence. She smiled because his joke
was funny. Do you see the formula? The

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,120
result? She smiled. And why did she smile?
The reason is his joke was funny. And

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,480
what's that little bridge holding it all
together? You guessed it, because! Works

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,620
like a charm every time. Okay, you've
totally nailed level one. So are you

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,780
ready for the pro move? I know you are.
Let's level up your skills and flip this
whole thing

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
right on its head.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,940
So check this out. We've got the two
styles side by side. On the left, our
standard way.

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,460
But look over on the right at the pro
move. Because his joke was funny, she
smiled. See

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,780
what we did there? We just put the reason
first. This is such a cool trick to make

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,700
your English sound more interesting and
varied. But, and this is a big but. When
you

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,980
use this awesome pro move, there's one
really, really important rule you've got
to follow.

33
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,460
When, because, is the very first word in
your sentence, well, you need to bring in
a special

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,940
little friend. And here it is, our special
friend is the comma.

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,700
You have to put a comma right after the
reason part.

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,900
So it's because his joke was funny, comma,
she smiled.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,500
This tiny little mark is a super powerful
friend that makes your sentence sound
perfect.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,780
But whatever you do, don't forget it!

39
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,020
Alright, you know the moves, you've
learned the rules, now it's game time.

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,100
Let's do a quick challenge so you can test
out your new superpower.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,860
And don't worry, this is going to be fun,
I promise!

42
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,060
Okay, here's your first challenge.

43
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,660
The Japanese is 雨がひょっていたので私は家にいた.

44
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Your mission is to unscramble those
English words and build the right
sentence.

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,180
Go ahead, take a second to think about it.
How'd you do?

46
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,700
Did you get it? The answer is, I stayed
home because it was raining.

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,580
That's our classic formula, right? Result
because reason. See?

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,920
You're totally getting the hang of this.
Awesome job.

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,900
Ready for round two? Let's do it!
試験に浮かったので 彼女は幸せだった。

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,940
Okay, how would you put these words
together? Take a good look.

51
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,780
Yes, that's it. She was happy because she
passed the exam.

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,140
Hey, wait a second.

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,740
That's the same sentence from the
beginning of our explainer.

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,900
Look at you! You're already becoming a pro
with the basic formula.

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,140
That is fantastic! Alright, I think it's
time for a trickier one.

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,180
Take a close look. This one starts with
because.

57
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,940
Uh-huh, that's our pro move. The Japanese
is 寝むかったので彼女は早く寝た.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,920
So how do you unscramble these words?

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,560
And hey, don't forget about our tiny
powerful friend. Awesome work!

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,480
The correct answer is, because she was
sleepy, she went to bed early.

61
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,500
And look right there. You see it?

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,540
little comma friend right after Sleepy.
That is a perfect pro-level sentence. You
are doing

63
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
so great.

64
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,500
Okay, here we go. The final challenge. You
are so ready for this.

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Hiduchu shoku wo tabenakatta no de karewa
harapeko datta.

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Yep, this one also kicks off with because.
Give it your best shot. You can do this.

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,220
Perfect. The answer is, because he didn't
eat lunch, he was hungry. You did it. You

68
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,380
totally crushed both the basic formula and
the pro move. And hey, even if you

69
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,940
stumbled a little bit, that is totally
okay. Every single mistake is just a part
of learning.

70
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,580
Seriously, great work.

71
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,580
So now that you're basically a master of
because, let's add a few more tools to
your toolkit.

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,160
See, because isn't flying solo. It's part
of an amazing team of words called
conjunctions.

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,380
So check out this chart. You can see
because in some of its teammates. You've
got when,

74
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,780
which connects ideas about time, you've
got if, which connects ideas about
conditions.

75
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,340
They all work in a really similar way. And
you know what the coolest part is? That

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,860
pro move with the comma, it works for
these guys too.

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,900
And just like that, mission complete.

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,860
You came here to learn, and now you are
officially an explainer.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,960
You seriously have the superpower to
connect results and reasons, just like a
native speaker.

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,680
How cool is that? So let's do a super fast
recap of your new power.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,980
Number one, because tells us the reason
why.

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,140
Number two, we've got two main patterns,
result because reason, and the pro move

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,460
because reason result. And number three,
the golden rule.

84
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,420
For that second pattern, you can never
forget the comma.

85
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,300
You have done such an amazing job today
for real.

86
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,660
You now have this incredible superpower to
explain literally anything.

87
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,060
So my final question for you is this,
what's the first thing you're going to
explain?

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,220
Go out there and use your new power.
You've totally got this.

89
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,740
Thanks so much for hanging out with me
today.
