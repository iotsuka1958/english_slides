1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Hey there, and welcome!

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,560
In just the next few minutes, we're going
to unlock a huge part of English
communication

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
with one simple, super powerful word.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,300
Yep, we're talking about the word that
answers the biggest question of all, the
question

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,480
of why. So everything really starts with a
simple observation, right?

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,960
A statement of fact that's perfectly fine
on its own, but it leaves us wanting a
little

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
more.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,160
It kind of sets up this mini-puzzle that
our brains just can't wait to solve.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,780
this sentence, for example, she was happy.
Okay, it's a complete thought. We get the

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,740
emotion. But something's missing, isn't
there? It just feels a little incomplete.
Exactly.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,920
The question that just pops into your head
is, why? Why was she happy? Without a
reason,

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,880
the statement has no depth, no story. And
to build that story, to add that meaning,

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,520
We need a special tool. And here it is.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
This is our tool, our key, the word
because.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,420
This is the word we use to connect a
situation to its cause, an effect to its
reason.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,520
You can think of it as the bridge that
takes us from what happened to why it
happened.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,200
So let's get specific for a second.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,120
Because is a conjunction, and its only job
really is to link a result like she was

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,200
happy with its reason, the why part.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,440
It's basically the glue that holds a full
explanation together.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,460
Now, here's what's really cool.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,380
We can use this key in two fundamental
ways.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,500
Think of them as two blueprints for
building a clear explanatory sentence.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,860
Once you know these two patterns, you're
absolutely set.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,060
And here they are.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,580
Blueprint 1 states the result first, and
then it gives the reason.

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,660
Result because reason. Blueprint 2, well,
it just flips that order.

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,300
It starts with the reason, but, and this
is super important, you have to add a
comma

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,500
like to separate it from the result.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,040
All right, theory's great and all,

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,820
but let's actually put it into practice.

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,340
We're gonna do a quick workshop with a few
sentence puzzles

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,980
so you can try out our two blueprints.
Ready? Here's the first one.

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,020
We've got the result, I stayed home. And
the jumbled up reason

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,380
is right there in the parentheses. How
would you put that together

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,700
using our first blueprint? And there it
is.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,860
I stayed home because it was raining.

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,300
A perfect example of blueprint one.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,900
The result comes first, followed by
because,

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,300
and then the reason, simple and crystal
clear.

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,780
Okay, let's try another one, and this
should look pretty familiar.

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,180
She was happy. We finally have the pieces
to explain why.

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,060
So how do we solve this one? You got it.

44
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,500
She was happy because she passed the exam.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,460
This structure with the result first

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,180
is probably the most common and natural
way

47
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,900
you'll hear because used in just everyday
conversation.

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,820
Okay, time for a little twist.

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,700
Notice this sentence starts with because.

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,620
The scrambled words give us the reason for
going to bed early.

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,020
How does this one come together using our
second blueprint?

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,060
And this is a brilliant illustration of
our second pattern.

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
Because she was sleepy, she went to bed
early.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,380
We start with the reason, add that
essential comma, and then state the
result.

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,040
The meaning is identical, but starting
with the reason can add a little more
emphasis

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,900
to it, you know? Last one for the
workshop.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,620
Again, it begins with because.

58
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,180
This one's a little trickier maybe,
because it's got a negative in there.

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,020
Take a moment and sort out why he was
hungry. Fantastic.

60
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,100
Because he didn't eat lunch, he was
hungry.

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,220
The reason is stated right at the
beginning, followed by that comma and the
result.

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,220
And just like that, you've mastered both
fundamental ways to explain why.

63
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,100
So, here's the really crucial point.

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,500
Those two blueprints you just mastered
for, because, they aren't just for
explaining

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
reasons.

66
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,540
actually a master key that unlocks how we
use a whole family of important connecting

67
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,240
words in English. Just look at this.

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,100
The same two blueprints work for other
conjunctions, too.

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,380
For time, you can use when. He was hungry
when he got up.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,520
Or flip it around. When he got up, he was
hungry.

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,320
For conditions, you can use if. You will
succeed if you work hard.

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,620
Or if you work hard, you will succeed. See
that?

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,080
The structure is identical.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,600
By mastering because you've learned a
pattern that applies all over the
language.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,560
So you don't just have a key anymore.

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,220
You have a set of master blueprints for
building clearer, more powerful sentences.

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,640
You have the tools to connect ideas, to
explain the why behind the what.

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,480
So the only question left is, what will
you build with them?
