00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
What's up English adventurers are you
ready to level up your grammar game today?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,220
We're going on an awesome quest to unlock
a secret weapon in English the two
infinitive. Let's do this

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,840
So get this did you know verbs are kind of
like superheroes you think you know them

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,560
But they have a secret identity a hidden
power that lets you talk about all your
dreams and hobbies in a brand new way

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm not kidding

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
Okay, so let's take a super simple verb
play. We all know this one

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,480
I play games. Easy-peasy, right? The verb
is the action. It's what I'm doing. But,
that's not the

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,320
whole story. But what if you want to talk
about, you know, the idea of playing
games, like the

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,240
activity itself? You can't just say, play
games is fun. Ah, that sounds a little
weird, doesn't it?

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,240
To make it work, we need a little bit of
English magic. And here it is. The magic
spell is

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,080
the two infinitive. You probably know this
as two futeishi in your classes. And it's
so simple.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,280
You just stick the word two in front of a
verb and bam, it's not an action anymore.
It's a thing.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,960
It becomes a noun that means the act of
doing something. So check out the
difference here.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,920
On the left, I play games. That's me doing
an action. But on the right, to play games
is fun.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
See that? The whole idea of playing games.
That is the thing that's fun. The verb
just

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,040
just got a promotion. It's the star of the
show now.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,680
All right, Graham requesters, your first
power up is unlocked.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,660
We're gonna master the subject skill

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,280
where we make our new to infinitive

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,900
the main character of the sentence.

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,720
Okay, let's look at a super easy sentence.
Science is fun.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,160
Here, science is the subject, right?

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,480
It's the main topic, nice and simple. Now
watch this.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,760
And bam, we use our new superpower to
study science is fun.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
Did you see what we did there?

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,640
We took the action, study, and turned it
into the main character of the whole
sense.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
The act of studying science is now the
thing that's fun.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,400
And here's the best part, you can use this
for literally anything you care about.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,640
To play video games is my favorite hobby.
Totally true for me.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
To watch anime is awesome.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,960
Heck yeah it is, or you can talk about
your big dreams.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,480
To become a famous creator is my dream. So
cool, right? Level up!

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Awesome job everyone. Now for power-up
number two, the object skill.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
And let me tell you, this is the one
you're gonna use

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,320
all the time in real conversations. Okay,
let's start simple again.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,520
I like cookies. I mean, who doesn't?

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,320
So I is the subject, like is the verb, and
cookies is the object.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,840
It's the thing I like. Hmm, I'm picturing
a warm,

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,960
gooey American chocolate chip cookie right
now.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,880
Okay, but what if you don't just like
eating them?

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,760
What if you like the action? Well, let's
use our magic word.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,600
I like to make cookies, see?

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Now the whole phrase to make cookies is
the object.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,560
It's the activity that you like, so cool.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay, to really get good at this,

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,280
you need to know about the boss verbs.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,520
Think of them like the main characters in
a video game

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
that always have a special sidekick,

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,240
and that sidekick is the two-infinitive.
So here's your new crew.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Want, like, need, decide, begin, start,
and continue.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,200
These verbs are your best friends.

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Whenever you use one of them, your brain
should be thinking,

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,880
ooh, a two verb is probably coming next.

54
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,540
Seriously, memorize these guys, they're
super important.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,280
And now you have the recipe for an awesome
sentence.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
It's just three easy steps. Step one, pick
a person, I.

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,460
Step two, pick a boss verb, want.

58
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,560
Step three, add your action with two, to
visit Hollywood.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,520
Boom, I want to visit Hollywood.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Or how about she decided to try an
American hamburger?

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,680
See, you can make endless sentences just
like this.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,800
And there you have it, quest complete.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
You've unlocked the two major skills of
the two infinitive.

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,560
But this isn't just about passing a
grammar test.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,840
This is about unlocking a real superpower.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
Because this is what it's all about.

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,240
This isn't just some boring rule from a
textbook. It's a key.

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,920
It's the key that lets you tell people
about your hopes,

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,080
your dreams, what you're passionate about.

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,960
It's how you express who you really are.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,280
So what did you win on this quest? The
power of expression.

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,760
Now you can actually say things like, I
want to be a YouTuber, or I decided to
join the

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,120
soccer team, or I need to study for the
test.

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,160
Your English communication skills just got
a huge boost.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,920
So my final challenge to you is this.
You've got this new superpower.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,480
What's the very first thing you want to
say with it?

77
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
What's your dream? What's your goal? Go
on.

78
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Try making a sentence right now. You guys
were awesome today.

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,820
Great work.
