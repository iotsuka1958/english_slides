1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Today, we're going to talk about one of the smallest, but honestly, one of the mightiest

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,920
words in the entire English language.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,880
It's just two letters, IF.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,040
But believe it or not, this tiny word shapes conditions, it opens up possibilities, and

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,380
it defines outcomes.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,760
So let's dive in and see how IF really works.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,639
Let's start with a sentence we've all heard a million times.

8
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,040
You will succeed if you work hard.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,600
It's pretty straightforward, right?

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,440
You've got a condition, working hard, and you've got a result, succeeding.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,760
It's clear, it's direct, no confusion there.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,759
But here's the big question for today.

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,240
What happens if we just flip it?

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,799
Does changing the order of the words change what it means?

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,000
Or maybe, does it change the impact?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,360
This one simple question is going to unlock a really fundamental rule of English grammar.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,639
Okay, so to really get a handle on IF, we first need to look at what its actual job

18
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,720
is inside a sentence.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,880
So grammatically speaking, IF kicks off what we call a clause.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,240
You know, just a little mini-idea with a subject and a verb.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,660
Its whole purpose is to set a condition.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,099
Just think of it as a substitute for the phrase, on the condition that.

23
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:11,680
So IF you work hard is just a shorter, punchier way of saying, on the condition that you work

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,099
hard.

25
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,320
So now we know what IF does.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,279
But here's where it gets interesting.

27
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,360
Turns out, there isn't just one right way to build these kinds of sentences.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Nope.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
They're two.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,820
And here they are, side by side.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,959
Now the most important thing to notice here is that the meaning is exactly the same.

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,839
In pattern 1, the main idea, you will succeed, comes first.

33
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:38,800
In pattern 2, the condition, if you work hard, comes first.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,639
Same ingredients, just a different recipe.

35
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:46,879
But while the meaning is identical, there's one tiny, and I mean absolutely critical difference

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,379
in the punctuation.

37
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,839
This is probably the most common mistake people make, but it's so, so easy to fix once you

38
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:53,940
see it.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,320
And here it is, the big secret.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,239
When the IF clause starts the sentence, you need a comma.

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,320
It's like a little speed bump, a tiny pause that separates the condition from the result.

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,039
If you work hard, you will succeed.

43
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,039
But if the IF part comes at the end, you don't need it.

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,360
It's as simple as that.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,080
Alright, theory's over.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,479
Now it's time to put what you've learned into practice.

47
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,639
I'm gonna throw a few jumbled up sentences on the screen, and I want you to try and unscramble

48
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,699
them in your head.

49
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,940
You ready for this?

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Let's go!

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,779
Okay, first one up.

52
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,419
The main result is you will feel better.

53
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,240
The condition is all jumbled up in the parentheses.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,979
How would you put that together?

55
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:33,979
Did you get it?

56
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:38,020
The answer is, if you drink water, you will feel better.

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,940
And because we started with IF, we absolutely need that comma.

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,179
Let's try another one with the same structure.

59
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:48,339
Okay, here the result is, you will have fun.

60
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:51,619
Go ahead and see if you can unscramble that condition.

61
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:55,339
And this one becomes, if you play soccer, you will have fun.

62
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,500
See the pattern emerging?

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,380
Okay, one more like this, just to really lock it in.

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
The result is, you're gonna learn a lot.

65
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,660
The condition has to do with reading books.

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,699
How does it go?

67
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,740
And the answer is, if you read books, you will learn a lot.

68
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Perfect.

69
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,240
Notice in all three of those, IF came first, which meant the comma was doing the important

70
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,419
work of separating the two ideas.

71
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,339
Alright, switch gears now.

72
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,500
Pay close attention to this one, because the structure's a little different.

73
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,720
The main idea is already there for you.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,940
We will watch a movie.

75
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,699
Now, how do you tack on the condition?

76
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,139
Exactly!

77
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,820
We will watch a movie if it rains.

78
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,100
This time, we're using that other pattern.

79
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,380
The IF clause is at the end, which means, what's missing?

80
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,820
That's right, no comma necessary.

81
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,100
Alright, last one, the grand finale.

82
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,619
We're starting with the main subject, we.

83
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,220
The rest is a bit of a mess.

84
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,259
Put all those pieces together to make a sentence that makes sense.

85
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,339
And you got it!

86
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,899
We will be happy if you smile.

87
00:03:55,899 --> 00:04:00,539
This uses our first pattern, so the IF is at the end, and we don't need a comma.

88
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,179
Fantastic job!

89
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,740
Okay, so you've seen the patterns.

90
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,660
You've put them into practice.

91
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,779
But now it's time for the final aha moment, the simple reason why this whole comma rule

92
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,300
even exists in the first place.

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,019
So let's do a super quick recap of what we've figured out.

94
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,899
Number one, IF just sets up a condition.

95
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,420
Number two, that condition can go at the beginning or at the end of the sentence.

96
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,420
And number three, the big one, you only use a comma when IF is the very first word.

97
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,059
And all of this leads to the big secret.

98
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,220
IF is a special kind of word called a conjunction.

99
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,220
Its whole purpose in life is to connect ideas.

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,100
In our sentence, it connects you will succeed with your card.

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,579
Now think of IF like a piece of tape.

102
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,739
When the tape is in the middle, it holds the two pieces of paper together perfectly.

103
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:52,459
But if you move that piece of tape to the very beginning, you need something else to

104
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,820
show where one piece of paper ends and the next one begins.

105
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,839
And that's the commas job.

106
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,500
So we end right where we started, but now you've got a whole new perspective.

107
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,859
You will succeed if you work hard, versus if you work hard, you will succeed.

108
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,980
Grammatically, they're identical.

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,380
But rhetorically?

110
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,160
Which one feels more powerful?

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,959
Which one lands with a bigger punch for you?

112
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,880
Now that is the art that lives just beyond the rules.

113
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,519
Something to think about.
