1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hey everyone and welcome. Have you ever
wanted to talk about who's number one? You
know,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,040
the absolute best, the greatest? Well,
today we're going to learn exactly how to
crown a champion

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,360
in English. I mean, think about it, we're
always ranking stuff, aren't we? Like,
what's the biggest

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,560
hit anime right now? Or who's the fastest
runner in your whole school? To talk about
stuff like

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,600
that, to really declare a winner, you kind
of need a secret code in English. And
guess what?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,560
Today, we're gonna crock that code
together.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
All right, let's jump right into our first
round.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,100
I'm calling this the championship rule.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,160
This is the most important step for
deciding

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,960
who or what is the absolute best.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,840
There's a secret formula and you're about
to learn it. You ready?

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,080
Okay, so here it is, the secret formula.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,440
For most short words that describe
something,

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,520
you know, like strong or fast, it's super
simple.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
You just put the right in front and then
you stick EST on the end.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,880
So, the plus the word plus EST, that's it.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
In grammar, this is called a superlative,

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,160
but let's just think of it as our number
one word.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Let's see it in action.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,880
All right, let's start with something we
all know.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,120
Mount Fuji is high, simple, right? Totally
true, but is it just high

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,280
or is it a true champion of height?

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,200
We can actually power up this sentence to
show just how special it is.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,960
And boom, look at that. Mount Fuji is the
highest in Japan.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,440
By adding the and est, the sentence
suddenly has way more punch, right?

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,480
It's not just a high mountain anymore.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,520
Now, it's the number one peak in all of
Japan. It's the highest.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,760
See how much cooler that sounds? Okay,
you're getting it.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's do another one. How about this? The
Nile River is long.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,160
Yeah, it's a perfectly fine sentence,

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,440
but fine is kind of boring, right? Let's
make it a world champion.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,280
And just like that, bam, the Nile River

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,160
is the longest in the world, see? We
didn't just say it was long,

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,640
we made it the undisputed global champion
of length

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
all with our simple little formula,

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
the plus long plus est, easy, right?

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
All right, so you've totally mastered the
basic rule.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
But hey, to be a real champion,

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,500
you need a few special moves up your
sleeve.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,920
So it's time for some spelling power-ups.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,720
These are some cool tricks for words

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,560
that, you know, like to play by their own
rules.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,760
First up is a really easy one. Let's call
it the STI shortcut.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
So, what do you do if a word already ends
with the letter E?

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, you get to use this awesome little
shortcut.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Okay, so take a word like large. See how
it already ends in E?

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,320
Well, you don't need to add the whole ST
thing again. That'd be silly.

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,440
You just add ST, that's it. So large
becomes the largest.

49
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,960
It's like an efficiency power-up, so much
faster.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,020
Okay, power-up number two. I call this one
the Y to I swap.

51
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,680
This is for words that end in Y, you know,
words like busy or happy.

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,280
The Y here is kind of like a ninja.

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,160
It has to transform to become number one.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,840
So here's how the magic trick works. Let's
take busy.

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,600
First, you say goodbye to that Y at the
end. Poof, it's gone.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,120
Then in its place, an I shows up.

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,280
And finally, you add our championship
ending, est.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,080
and Alakazam, busy transforms into the
busiest.

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,400
And now for our final expert level power
up.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,040
Get ready for the double up. This one's
for short words

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,560
that have a special pattern like big or
hot.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,480
To make them the champion, you gotta give
them a little extra boost.

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,320
So here's the deal. For a word like big,
you can't just add EST.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,760
Nope, you have to double that last letter
first. So big gets another G

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,200
and then it becomes the biggest.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,160
It's like that extra letter gives it the
superpower

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,240
it needs to win the championship.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,560
Okay, you've learned the championship
rule.

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,400
You've unlocked all the power-ups.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Now it's time to put your new skills to
the test.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,440
Welcome everyone to the final showdown.
I'm gonna give you a sentence

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,960
and you have to find the superlative. Are
you ready? Let's do this.

73
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,440
All right, question number one.

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,720
My grandfather is the blank in my family
and the word is old.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,200
This is just a little warm up. Pretty
straightforward.

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,960
Think you got it? And the answer is
oldest. Yes, perfect.

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,840
That's a textbook use of our main
championship rule. Awesome start.

78
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,880
Okay, on to the next one. Think a little
harder on this one.

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,000
Monday is the blank day at the store.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,280
The word is busy. Hmm, which power up are
you gonna need here?

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,920
The answer is busiest, exactly right. You
remembered the Y to I swap.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,220
You dropped that Y, swapped in the I and
added S, nice.

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,920
If you got that one, you are totally
getting the hang of this.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,600
And here we go, the final question of the
showdown.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,520
The desert is the blank place on earth.
Your word is hot.

86
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay, this is the expert level test.

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,560
Remember that last power-up we learned?

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,560
And the correct answer is, hottest, H-O-T-
T-E-S-T.

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,880
Yes, you nailed it. You remembered to use
the double up power up

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,000
to make that word a champion.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
You've officially passed the final
showdown, amazing.

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,720
You did it, seriously. You completed the
whole challenge

93
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,680
and you proved you know exactly how to
talk about being number one.

94
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,960
I hereby declare you an official
superlative champion.

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,580
So let's do a super quick recap of the
skills you just mastered.

96
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,300
First, the main championship rule, the
plus your word plus S.

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,960
Then you unlocked three awesome power-ups,

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,280
the S shortcut for words that end in E,

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,040
the clever Y to I swap for words like
busy,

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,440
and of course the powerful double up for
words like big.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,160
You've got all the tools now. So you now
have the secret code.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,800
You know how to talk about the best of the
best,

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,680
the highest, the longest, the busiest, the
hottest.

104
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,040
So I'm gonna leave you with one final
question.

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,680
Now that you're a champion of
superlatives,

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,960
what's something that you are the best at?
Think about it.

107
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Thanks so much for hanging out with me
today

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
and I'll catch you on the next one.
