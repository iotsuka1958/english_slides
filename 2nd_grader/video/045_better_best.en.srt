1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Are you ready to power up your English?
Today, we're going to unlock some super
special words that,

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,560
honestly, they just break all the normal
rules. If you can master these, you're
going to sound

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,240
so much more natural. Let's do this. So,
first off, a quick question for you.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,680
Think about your class at school. Who's
the fastest runner? Who's the funniest?
Or,

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,320
who's the best at video games? See, to
answer questions like these,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
you need the special words we're diving
into today.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,440
So, let's say you want to say, my friend
is a good singer.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
That sentence is perfect. But, what if you
want to compare?

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
You might think, logically, that she is
gooder than you.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
Makes sense, right? But, and this is a big
but,

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
that's a super common mistake.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,520
Some words in English don't just add ER.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,400
They have these secret power-ups, just
like in a video game.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
So, in this explainer,

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,360
we are going to learn all about these
special rules. We're going to see how some
words totally

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,080
transform when we use them to compare
stuff. So for these words, you can just
forget about

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,400
ur and est. They are way too cool for
that. Okay, let's kick things off with a
big talent show

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,960
showdown. In one corner, we have the word
good. And in the other corner, we've got
the word well.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,640
Now, they might seem kind of similar, but
trust me, they have very different jobs.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,520
Let's see how they do. First up, let's
meet Janice.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,240
The sentence says, Janice is a good
singer.

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,160
So here the word good is describing
Janice.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,500
More specifically, it's telling us what
kind of singer she is.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,880
Good is what we call an adjective, and its
job is just to describe a person, a place,

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,000
or a thing. Pretty simple, right?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
But wait, what happens when her friend
Linda jumps into the competition?

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Now we're comparing two people, and we
can't say good or no way.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,560
Instead, Good gets its first power-up and
transforms into better.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,960
So we say, Janice is a better singer than
Linda.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,840
We're comparing one person against
another.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,320
And now for the final round.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,480
Janice is up against everyone in the whole
school.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,840
So to say she's number one, Good has to
use its ultimate power-up.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,600
And it becomes the best. Janice is the
best singer of all. This is it.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,360
The top level. The final evolution.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
remember, good, better, the best.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,040
Alright, let's bring out our next
contestant, Billy.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
This slide says, Billy plays the piano
well.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Now, pay close attention here. Are we
describing Billy himself?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,240
Hmm, not really. We're describing how he
plays.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,040
The word well describes the action, the
verb plays, so well is an adverb.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,240
But what happens when his buddy John
starts playing too?

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,340
We need to compare them. And here's where
it gets really interesting.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,940
it out. Well, also transforms into better,
just like Good did.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,980
Billy plays the piano better than John.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,480
It's the same power-up, just from a
different starting word.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,700
And I bet you can guess what's next.

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,140
When we compare Billy to everyone else in
the school, Well uses its ultimate power-
up

49
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,340
to become, you got it, the best.

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Billy plays the piano the best in his
school.

51
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,860
It shares the exact same awesome power-ups
as Good.

52
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,940
So here's the main thing you gotta
remember.

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,940
is an adjective. It describes people and
things. Well is an adverb. It describes
actions. They

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,900
have different jobs, for sure. But when
it's game time, when you need to compare,
they

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,620
both level up to better and the best.

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,640
Okay, the talent show is over. Time for a
totally new challenge. Let's head on over

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
to the school festival for an eating
contest. This is where we're going to
learn our

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,420
next set of special words, many versus
much.

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Now before we start this contest, there's
one quick rule we need to know. In
English,

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,100
Some things are countable, like cookies or
hot dogs.

61
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,660
You can literally count them, one, two,
three.

62
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,980
But other things are uncountable, like
tea, water, or rice.

63
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,100
You can't really count the liquid itself,
right?

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,020
You count the cups or the bottles.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,300
This difference is super, super important
for our next two words.

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,180
First up is Bob, and he is going to town
on those cookies.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,380
Now, can you count cookies? Yep, you sure
can.

68
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,980
So for things we can count, we use the
word many.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,460
Bob ate too many cookies. But hold on,
here comes John.

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,060
It's a competition now.

71
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,980
To compare the number of cookies these two
ate, many gets a power-up.

72
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,880
It transforms into more. So we say, Bob
ate more cookies than John.

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,540
And to win the family championship, Bob's
gonna need that ultimate power-up.

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,380
For the largest number of countable
things, many becomes the most.

75
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,540
Bob ate the most cookies in his family. He
is the champion.

76
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,240
Okay, let's switch over to the drink
station. Janice is back.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,080
This time, Janice drank too much tea. Can
you count tea?

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Nope, it's a liquid, it's uncountable.

79
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,400
And that's exactly why we use the word
much.

80
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
And look, Linda's here too.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,960
So when we compare them, guess what
happens?

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
Much also powers up to more, just like
many did.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,480
Janice drank more tea than Linda.

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,920
And you guessed it, the ultimate power up
here is also the most.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,220
It's another one of those awesome shared
power-ups.

86
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,620
Okay, you've seen all the words in action,
you've seen them compete,

87
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,100
and now it's time for the big reveal.

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
Let's put everything we've just learned
together

89
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
on one ultimate cheat sheet. This is like
the secret code

90
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
to sounding like a native English speaker.
Take a look.

91
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,020
This chart makes everything super clear.

92
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,420
You can see the pattern, right?

93
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,140
Good and well start off as different
words,

94
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,380
but then bam, they both power up to better
and the best.

95
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,940
And the exact same thing happens with many
and much.

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,900
They both level up to more and the most.

97
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,340
So they start in different places,

98
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,260
but they end up sharing the same power-
ups.

99
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,940
All right, you've seen the rules,

100
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,380
and now you have the ultimate cheat sheet.

101
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,880
So it's your turn to be the champion.

102
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,460
Let's see if you've really mastered these
special rules

103
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,540
with a quick little quiz. You ready? Here
we go, first question.

104
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,380
Janus sings blank, then Linda. Hmm, think
about it.

105
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,480
Are we describing Janice, the person,

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,240
or are we describing how she sings, the
action?

107
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,440
And we're comparing two people,

108
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,180
so what word do you think goes in that
blend?

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,120
And the answer is better, yes! We are
describing the action sings,

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,720
so our base word as well. And because
we're comparing her to Linda,

111
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,420
it powers up to better, you got it,
excellent job.

112
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,880
You've totally got the secret code now.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
You know how to say someone is better, or
has more,

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,360
or is simply the best. So my final
question for you is this,

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,040
who will you say is the best at something?

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,440
Go on, try using one of these awesome
power-up words today.

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
Thanks for hanging out with me.
