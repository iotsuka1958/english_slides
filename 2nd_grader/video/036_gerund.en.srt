1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Have you ever noticed how that little ING
ending in English seems to be, well,
everywhere?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
It shows up on verbs, it acts like a noun,
it describes things, I mean, it's a real

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
workhorse of the language.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,800
But let's be honest, it can also be a
little bit of a puzzle.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,560
So today we are going to crack the code on
one of its most important and maybe most

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
confusing jobs. Okay, let's just dive
right in.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
We're going to start by looking at a super
common point of confusion, a place where

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,440
this simple three-letter ending creates a
real head scratcher.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,360
So here's the mystery we're gonna solve
today.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,680
On the surface, the two sentences you're
about to see

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,680
look almost the same, but that one word
listening

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
is pulling off a pretty clever trick.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
The question is, what exactly is it doing?
Okay, here we go.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,540
In that first sentence, her hobby is
listening to the radio.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,560
The word listening is basically the name
of an activity.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,880
It's a thing, right? It's her hobby.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,840
But in the second one, she is listening to
the radio.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,620
It's all about action. It's what she's
doing right this very second.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,900
So same word, totally different jobs. How
is that possible?

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,500
What is going on here? Well, it's time to
pull back the curtain

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,920
and solve this mystery by introducing the
hero of our story today.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,300
It's a special kind of word that
absolutely loves to go undercover.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,980
It's called a gerund. And you know, the
absolute best way to think

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,920
about a gerund is that it's a verb, an
action word,

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,680
that puts on an in costume so it can sneak
around

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,320
and do the job of a noun. It's a master of
disguise,

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,520
turning an action into a thing you can
talk about.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,920
And really, it all boils down to this
simple formula.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,080
You take a verb, any verb, like read or
swim,

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,720
you slap ing on the end and boom,

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,800
it's not just an action anymore, it's a
noun.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,440
It's the activity of reading or the
concept of swimming.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,600
It's no longer just something you do, it's
the idea of doing it.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
So now that we know its secret identity,

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,720
Let's go on a little safari and see where
the shape-shifting word likes to show up.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,920
It has a few favorite hangouts in a
sentence.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Turns out you can usually find gerunds in
one of three main spots.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,120
They can be the subject, you know, the
main character of the whole sentence.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,040
They pop up after b-verbs, like is, am, or
are, and they can be the object, the thing

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,800
getting the action from another verb.
Let's take a look at each one.

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
So in this sentence, what's actually good
for your health?

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not just the vegetables, right? It's
the activity of eating them.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,560
That gerund eating is the subject of the
entire sentence.

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,360
It's the thing this whole sentence is
about.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Now check out the structure here.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
It's basically a perfect little equation.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,080
His job equals helping students. See that?

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
The gerund helping comes right after the
verb IS and it renames or defines what the
job

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,320
IS. His job IS that activity. And here we
have our third spot.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,940
What did he start? He started laughing.

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,800
The gerund laughing is the direct object
of the verb started.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
It's the thing that received the action.
Simple as that.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay, seems pretty straightforward, right?

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Verb plus ing equals a noun. Got it.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,960
But you know, just when you think you've
got English figured out, it loves to throw

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
a curveball.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,460
It turns out the gerund has a rival,
something that often tries to do the exact
same job.

58
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,560
And here it is, the rival we were talking
about, the two infinitive.

59
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Just look at these two sentences. One uses
the gerund, speaking.

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,600
The other uses the infinitive, to speak.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,400
But here's the wild part, they mean the
exact same thing.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,480
In a lot of cases, they are totally
interchangeable.

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,360
And that of course leads us to the million
dollar question.

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,560
If they can often do the same job, can we
just swap them out whenever we feel like
it?

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,760
And the answer, maybe not so surprisingly
for English, is a big fat no.

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,040
You see, some verbs are just picky. They
have their preferences.

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,600
Verbs like enjoy and finish, for instance.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
They only want to work with a gerund.

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
You can say, I enjoy playing golf, but I
enjoy to play golf.

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
It just sounds wrong to a native speaker,
doesn't it?

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
These verbs demand a gerund as their
partner.

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,280
All right, let's bring it all home.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,380
Now that we know what a gerund is and what
it isn't, we have all the tools we need

74
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,160
to finally solve that mystery from the
very beginning.

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
So let's go back to the scene of the
crime.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,040
What is really the difference here?

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,260
One sentence is talking about the hobby of
listening, which is a noun, a concept.

78
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,440
And the other is talking about the action
of listening, which is a verb, something
happening

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,320
right now. How can we tell them apart for
good? Here it is.

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
This is the definitive test.

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,180
In that first sentence, her hobby is
collecting stamps.

82
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,160
The ing word is a gerant. Why? Because you
can use an equal sign.

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Her hobby equals the activity of
collecting.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
They are the same concept.

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,020
a noun. But in the second one, she IS
collecting stamps, that ING word is just
doing its normal

86
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,700
verb job. Its fancy name is a present
participle, and it's just showing an
ongoing action.

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,360
The equals test totally fails here. She
does not equal collecting. She is a
person, collecting

88
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,100
is the action she is doing. That's the key
difference.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,340
So there you have it. You know the secret.
You cannot tell the difference between a

90
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,200
verb wearing a noun costume and a verb
that's just, you know, being a verb. Let's

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's wrap this up into your new grammar
superpower.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
Think of this as your personal three-step
Jaren spotting guide.

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,120
Step one, find the word ending in ING.
Easy enough.

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
Step two, ask yourself, is this thing
acting like a noun?

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,760
Is it naming an activity or an idea?

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,320
And finally, step three, check its job. Is
it the subject?

97
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Is it the object?

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,440
Or, and this is the big one, does it pass
that equals test after the verb is?

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,320
If the answer is yes, congratulations,
you've spotted a Jaren in the wild.

100
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,760
The gerund is just this brilliant little
piece of English grammar that lets us talk
about

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,680
actions as if they were actual things.

102
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,680
It's what lets us say running is my
favorite exercise, or I really hate
cleaning.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,280
So now that you know it's secret identity,
the only question left is where are you
going

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,680
to spot this amazing verb in disguise
next?
