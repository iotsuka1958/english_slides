00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to the explainer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know, sometimes the most common words
in English are the sneakiest.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we're going to pull back the
curtain on one of the best examples, the
gerund.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These are basically verbs living a secret
double life.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And once you see it, you'll see it
everywhere. Let's dive in.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And that secret life really boils down to
this one kind of weird question.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How can an action, you know, something you
do, also be a thing, a concept?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It seems impossible, right?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,280
Well, that's the puzzle we're going to
solve right now.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,480
Okay, let's start super simple. Take the
sentence, exercise is fun. Here the word
exercise is the

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,160
subject. It's a noun. It's a thing we're
talking about. Easy enough, right? Now we
could also say

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,400
to run is fun. See what's happening? The
phrase to run that's called an infinitive

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,760
is doing the exact same job as exercise.
It's not an action someone's doing. It's
the idea

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,200
of running that's fun. It's acting like a
noun. And this, this brings us to our main
event.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,240
Running is fun. Look at that. A word that
looks for all the world like a verb,
running,

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,920
is actually doing the job of a noun. This
is our shapeshifter. This is the gerund.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,640
It's an action that's been packaged up
into a thing.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,880
So let's get a closer look at this verb in
disguise. What is a gerund, really?

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,800
And how does it manage to pull off this
awesome grammatical magic trick?

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,840
Well, here's the official definition for
you.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,960
A gerund is simply a verb that ends in
I-N-G.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,280
But, and this is the crucial part, it acts
as a noun in the sentence.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,920
It's not describing an action that's
happening right now,

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,240
it's naming the activity itself. And
because it's a noun in disguise,

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,200
it can do all the jobs a regular noun can.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
For example, it can be the subject of a
sentence,

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,640
like in eating vegetables is good for your
health.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Or it can be a compliment, which kind of
restates the subject.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
His job is helping students.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,960
And of course, it can be the object that
receives an action.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,400
He started laughing. Now, you probably
remember from the beginning

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
that infinitives, that's the two form of a
verb, like to run,

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,120
can do a really similar job.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,400
And this sets up a little friendly
competition,

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
what I like to call the infinitive
rivalry.

36
0:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,360
A lot of the time, it really doesn't
matter which one you use.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,040
A gerund and a two-infinitive can be
totally interchangeable,

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,760
saying speaking English is difficult means
the exact same thing as to speak English
is difficult.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Same with I love singing versus I love to
sing. In these cases, they get along just
fine.

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,360
But that rivalry isn't always so friendly.
See, sometimes one of them gets a little
possessive.

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,600
There are specific cases where only a
gerant is allowed to show up.

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,440
And that's because some verbs are just
picky.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,720
Verbs like enjoy or finish, they
absolutely demand to be followed by a
gerund.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,280
You can say, I enjoy playing golf, but I
enjoy to play golf?

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,560
Nope, that just sounds all wrong. Same
with finish.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,040
She finished writing. She never finished
to write.

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,760
Okay, time for a quick pop quiz. Let's see
if you are listening.

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,680
How would you finish this sentence the
right way? She finished, what?

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,920
You got it. She finished writing the
letter.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,640
because the verb finish is one of those
picky verbs that always always takes a
gerund.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,960
See? Once you know the rule, it's pretty
simple.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,600
All right, there is one last piece of spy
craft we need to cover, and honestly,

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
this is the big one. It's how to spot the
gerund's nearly identical twin.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,440
It's look like imposter, the present
participle.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,680
Okay, look really closely at these two
sentences.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,400
They both use the word listening, but in
that first one, listening is a thing.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,880
It's a gerant. In the second one, it's an
action, a present participle.

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,600
So how on earth are you supposed to tell
them apart?

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Don't worry, I've got a super simple trick
for you. I call it the equal sign test.

60
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Just ask yourself if you can replace the
verb is with an equal sign.

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,080
So, her hobby equals listening to the
radio. Does that make sense?

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,760
Yes, it totally does. Her hobby is that
activity.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,320
If the equal sign works, you've found
yourself a gerant.

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,600
Now, let's try it on the other sentence.
She equals listening? No way. That makes
zero sense.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,440
She's a person, not an activity. She is
doing the action of listening. So in this
case,

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,600
listening is a present participle. It's
just part of a verb tense describing an
action in

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,560
progress, not a thing itself. So there you
have it. The secret life of verbs is out
in

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,280
the open. Jurins are absolutely
everywhere, hiding in plain sight, turning
actions into

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,760
ideas. Now that you know their secret
identity and you know how to spot them,
where else are

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,240
you going to see these amazing verbs in
disguise?
