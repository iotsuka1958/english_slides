1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
What's up, everyone? Are you ready to
become an English detective?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,640
Today, we're going to crack a secret code.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,520
A special phrase that answers the biggest,
most important question of all, why?

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,680
Let's get into it. You know, think about
it for a second.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,560
Every day, we see people doing all sorts
of things.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,480
They're running, they're studying, they're
going places.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,640
But just knowing what they're doing, well,
that's only half the story.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
The real story, the super interesting
part, is the reason behind it all.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,820
So today we're gonna uncover that why,
ready? Okay, check this out.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,540
She went to the station. I mean, it's a
sentence, it works,

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,100
but it kind of leaves you hanging, right?

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,620
It makes you go, hmm, but why? Why'd she
go there?

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,660
Was she catching a train to Tokyo? Meeting
up with a friend?

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,820
We need the details. Well, you are in luck

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,780
because today we are unlocking the magic
words.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,900
This is the secret code that answers our
why question

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,500
like every single time. It's super simple,
it's really powerful,

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,860
and you're about to become a master at
using it. Whoa, okay.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,940
Don't let this big fancy grammar name
scare you off.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,820
Adverbial to infinitive. All that is is
just an expert way of saying

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,720
we use to plus a verb to explain why we do
something.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,940
Just think of it like this.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,740
It's the phrase that means in order to do
something.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,100
That's it, it's our key. So let's start
with a really basic action.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,220
You hear this one all the time, right?

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,580
Your teachers say it, your parents say it,
you must work hard.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,580
And yeah, it's great advice for sure. But
again, why?

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,820
What's the point? What's the goal?

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,980
And boom, there it is, to pass the exam.

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,180
That's our secret code right there in
action.

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,820
That little phrase, to pass, tells us the
entire reason,

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,420
the whole purpose for working hard. So
here's the main point.

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,580
Two plus verb is the direct answer to the
question, why?

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,020
And once you know what to look for,

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,140
you start seeing this code everywhere.
Let's solve these missions.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,940
I got up early, but why? To catch the
first train.

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,740
And what about our original mystery? She
went to the station. Why?

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,060
To meet her parents. Mission solved. Or
how about this one?

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,760
He practices every day to join the
basketball team.

40
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,340
That's a great goal. And my personal
favorite,

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,780
I saved my money to buy tickets for the
Taylor Swift concert.

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,220
I mean, yes, the Eris tour. Absolutely
worth it.

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,100
See how that little why makes every
sentence so much more interesting?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,540
Okay, you have officially learned the
secret code.

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,700
So level one is complete. Now it's time
for level two,

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,500
becoming a true master of style. So the
next question is,

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,220
where exactly can we put this awesome
phrase in a sentence?

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,420
So turns out you've got options, which is
cool.

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,300
You can do what we've been doing and put
the main action first

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,860
and then the purpose at the end.

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,260
You must work hard to pass the exam,
simple.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,100
But if you wanna sound a little more
dramatic,

53
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,080
you can put the purpose first. To pass the
exam, you must work hard.

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,080
The meaning is exactly the same, but look
really closely.

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
When you put the why at the beginning,

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,560
you have to add that super important
little comma right there.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,240
Here are a couple more great examples of
putting that purpose first.

58
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,160
To save money, we eat at home.

59
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,560
The goal is super clear from the very
beginning

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,100
or to help his parents, he cleans the
house every day.

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,280
Putting that reason upfront is a really
strong

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
and clear way to communicate what you
mean.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
All right team, you've learned the code,

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,140
you've learned the different styles.

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,940
I think it's time to put those skills to
the test. It's quiz time.

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,360
Let's see if you can unscramble these
sentences and find the why.

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,120
You ready? Here is your first mission. The
words are all jumbled up.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Your job is to figure out the action,
figure out the purpose,

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,560
and put them together in the right order.
I'll give you a second.

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Go for it. And the answer is, they went to
the park to play baseball.

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,320
The action, they went to the park. the
reason why to play baseball.

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,460
Did you get it right? Awesome work. All
right, you are on a roll.

73
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,340
Let's keep that energy going. Here's round
two.

74
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,080
We've got studied, French, Go, and France.
So what's the story here?

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Get unscrambling. Yes, he studied French
to go to France.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Fantastic. The action is studying French.

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,080
And the purpose, the dream is to go to
France.

78
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,400
He probably wants to see the Eiffel Tower.
Now that is an awesome why.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, last challenge for you and I want
you to pay close attention.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,800
This one gives you a massive clue. The
very first word is two.

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,480
What does that tell you about how the
sentence is gonna be built?

82
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,280
You got this. And the correct answer is

83
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,460
to buy a new bike, she saved money. Nailed
it.

84
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,400
You saw that two at the beginning

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,440
and you knew the purpose was gonna come
first,

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,680
followed by that super important comma.
You guys are officially pros.

87
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,840
Incredible job on that quiz. Seriously.

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,800
So let's wrap this up with a quick summary

89
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,720
and then I'm gonna share one final expert
level tip

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,200
that will help you avoid a really common
mix up.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,520
After this, you will never get it wrong
again.

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,200
Okay, I want you to look really closely at
this slide

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,560
because this can be a little tricky
sometimes.

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Both of these sentences start with to
study English

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,880
but in the first one to study English is
very important.

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,220
We're talking about the act of studying.
It's the what. It's a thing.

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,000
But in our second sentence, to study
English, he went to Australia, we're
talking about

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,600
our secret code for why. And that little
comma is the big visual clue.

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,880
It's like a secret signal that tells you,
hey, this is the reason for the action.

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,920
That's a pro tip right there. So let's put
it all together.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,200
Here is your brand new superpower in four
easy steps, your why power up.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,120
Step one, find the action. What's
happening?

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
Step two, ask yourself why.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Step three, use the secret code 2 plus
verb to give the reason.

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,440
And step four, choose your style.

106
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,560
Put the code at the end or at the start
with a comma.

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
That's the whole thing.

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,960
This last example really brings our whole
mission together.

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,400
We're looking at a simple sentence again.

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
She studied hard to pass the exam.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,840
But now, you don't just see a bunch of
words, do you? You see a story.

112
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,600
You see an action and you see a clear
purpose.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,440
You have officially cracked the code.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,260
So remember, this isn't just about
grammar.

115
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,680
This is about your life and your goals.

116
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
So I'm going to leave you with this
question. What's your why?

117
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,080
What's the purpose behind what you're
doing?

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,120
Maybe it's to join the soccer team, or to
travel to America, or just to learn
something

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
new.

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,440
Whatever your goal is, now you know
exactly how to say it in English.

121
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,120
Thanks for cracking the code with me
today.
