00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hey there! Ever feel like your English
sentences are a little, well, basic? Today
we're going to

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,560
unlock a kind of English superpower that's
going to change all that. It's called the

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Two-Infinitive, and trust me, it's the key
to expressing way bigger, cooler ideas.
So,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,400
let's get right into it. So, let me ask
you a question. What do you want to be in
the future?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
Maybe you want to become a famous
YouTuber, or maybe you hope to play piano
on a huge stage

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,640
someday. Did you hear that? To be, to
become, to play. You're already using this
amazing grammar

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,160
tool and you probably didn't even realize
it. Okay, so to really understand our new
superpower,

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
we've got to talk about the star player of
every single English sentence, the main
verb.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,760
This is the main action, right? It's
what's really happening. It's the
foundation for

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,360
everything and you're already a pro at
spotting it. Check this out. Super simple
sentence.

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,080
Small cats jump. So who are we talking
about? The small cats. And what's their
main action?

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
They jump. Boom. That's our main verb, our
star player. Easy peasy.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,920
But, you know, life is way more
complicated than just that, isn't it? What
happens when you want

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
to talk about a second action in the same
sentence? You can't just have two star
players

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
on the field at the same time. That would
be total chaos. So how do we solve this
little

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,480
grammar puzzle? Well, we call in a secret
agent, the two infinitive. The formula
couldn't

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,560
be simpler. It's just two plus the basic
form of a verb, like to run, to eat, to
sleep. Think of it

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,800
like a verb in disguise, on a secret
mission to make your sentences way more
interesting.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
All right, let's put this secret agent to
the test. We're going to start with a
really simple

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,160
frame, okay? I want x, where x is just
whatever it is you want. So a lot of the
time that x is

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,400
just a thing, a noun. For example, I want
a new video game. Our main verb, our star
player,

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,800
is want, and the video game is what we
want. Pretty standard stuff, right?

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,360
But what if the thing you want is actually
in action? Ha! This is where our secret
agent

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,480
totally shines. We just swap out the noun
for our two infinitive. I want to buy a
new video game.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,120
And just like that, we have two actions
working together in one sentence.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
Want is our star player and to buy is our
secret agent, making it all happen.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,260
Ok, now this next part is super super
important to remember.

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,440
Our star player, the main verb, it's kind
of like a chameleon.

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,560
It has to change its form depending on who
is doing the action, like I or he or she,

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
and when it's happening.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
For example, just look at how our star
player, like, has to change.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
If it's I, it's like. If it's he, it
becomes likes.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
You gotta add that S. And if we're talking
about the past, it's liked.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
See?

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,720
verb is always changing to follow the
rules. But, and this is the best part,
this is where

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,040
our secret agent verb reveals its true
superpower. While that star player is busy
changing all the

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,800
time, the two infinitive, it just stays
the same. I mean it, no matter who, no
matter when,

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,440
it never ever changes. Seriously, look at
this, the star player changes from like to
likes

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,760
to liked. But our secret agent, to make,
it stays exactly the same every single
time. To make,

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,360
to make, to make, that's its power. It's
reliable, it's consistent, and it honestly
makes your life

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,960
so much easier. So how do you spot this
secret agent in a sentence? Just look for
the word

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,280
two. It's like a special tag that
basically tells everyone else in the
sentence,

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,720
hey, this next verb, yeah, it's not the
star of the show, it's here on a secret
mission.

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,880
So, there you have it. Your new grammar
superpower. Let's do a quick recap. Number
one,

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,160
its formula is always 2 plus base verb.
Number two, its job is to add a second
action to your

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,840
sentence. And number three, the golden
rule. It never changes. So the power is
officially yours.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,400
You now have this awesome tool to express
bigger and better ideas. So my question
for you is,

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
is what do you plan to do with it? What do
you want to learn next?

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,700
And most importantly, what cool things
will you create?

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,720
Get out there and start building some
amazing sentences.

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,120
