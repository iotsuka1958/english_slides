00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Welcome! Today, we're going to master a phrase you probably use every single day â€“ have

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
to. What does it really mean and are you using it correctly? Well, let's find out.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,120
So, just think for a second. What's on your to-do list today? We all have one, right?

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,600
And that list is basically built around this idea of have to. It's the language we use

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,520
for all our daily obligations.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,520
Maybe it's a simple chore. When you say, I have to clean my room, you're not just

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,139
suggesting it's a good idea. No, you're saying it's a necessity. It's something

8
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,480
that just needs to get done.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,680
Or maybe it's some kind of external rule you've got to follow. Whether it's at

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,040
school or at your job, these outside rules create a really clear obligation for us.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,919
So here's the bottom line. Have to is all about things you're required to do, an obligation

12
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:52,959
or a necessity. It can come from an outside rule or just, you know, your own personal

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:57,919
plan. Think of it as a super close cousin to the word must.

14
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:01,720
Now here's a quick pro tip for you. In a natural, flowing conversation, you'll almost

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,360
never hear a native speaker say, have to with a pause. Instead, it just kind of blends together

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,040
into one sound, hafta. Go on, try saying it. I have to go. See? It just feels so much smoother,

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
doesn't it?

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,959
Alright, let's dig into our first key rule. This one is all about who you're talking

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,360
about. And honestly, it's the difference between sounding pretty good and sounding

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,160
fantastic.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,720
The pattern here is actually really simple. For almost everybody, I, you, we, they, we

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,959
just use have to. But watch what happens when we're talking about just one other person

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:42,080
or thing, a he, she, or it. The verb changes and gets that S at the end, becoming has to.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,639
And yep, you guessed it. The same thing happens with the sound here. In conversation, has

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,919
to becomes hasta. For example, he has to leave soon.

26
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:55,080
Okay, time for a quick check to make sure you've got this down. Take a look at the

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,839
subject. She. Which one do you think is correct here? Exactly! If you said has to, you nailed

28
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:07,400
it. Because she is a third-person singular subject, we need that S form, has to.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,199
Now let's see what happens to this rule when we start asking questions. Pay close

30
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,559
attention here, because this is where a really common mistake trips people up. But don't

31
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,080
worry, we're going to make it crystal clear.

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,919
So let's start with a simple positive statement. You have an obligation to study tonight. Easy

33
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,000
enough.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,020
Now to turn this into a question, we just pop the helping verb do right at the beginning.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,639
The rest of the sentence, you have to study, stays exactly the same. So far, so good, right?

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,440
But what about this one? Here, our statement uses has to, because the subject is he. Now

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,479
this, this is where the magic happens when we turn it into a question.

38
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,119
So how do we ask this? A lot of people get this one wrong. So think carefully. What helping

39
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:54,600
verb do we need, and what happens to has to?

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,880
And there it is. We use does because our subject is he. But look closely. Did you see it? The

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,559
has to switched back to have to. So why does that happen?

42
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:09,880
Here's the key takeaway, and it's a big one. Think of it like this. The helping verb does

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,679
is already doing all the heavy lifting. It has the S for the third person. And since

44
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:20,600
you only need that S once in the sentence, has to can just relax and go back to its original

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,119
form, have to. So remember, in questions with do or does, it's always have to.

46
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:30,100
Okay, now we've reached what is probably the single most important distinction in this

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,880
entire topic. The difference between these two negative forms is huge, and getting it

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,240
right is absolutely key to clear communication.

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,479
First up, we've got don't have to. This one is simple and pretty friendly. It just removes

50
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,199
the obligation. It means something isn't required. You can totally do it if you want,

51
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,559
but you don't have to. You've got a choice.

52
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:52,759
And this is where the meaning becomes so critical. I mean, look at this. If someone says, you

53
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,679
don't have to eat it, they're giving you a choice. Maybe you're full. No big deal. But

54
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:02,520
if they say, you must not eat it, whoa, that is a strong prohibition. It's forbidden. Maybe

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,039
it's dangerous. Maybe it's poison. As you can see, these two phrases are not interchangeable

56
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,039
at all.

57
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:13,160
Okay, whew, that was a lot of ground to cover. So, let's bring it all together in one simple

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,619
cheat sheet so you have everything you need in one place.

59
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:21,239
And here it is, your complete guide. You can see the whole system laid out right here.

60
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,059
The S-form, you know, has to and doesn't have to, that's only for he, she, and it. And notice

61
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:30,320
how in any question, it always goes back to have to. But most importantly, you can see

62
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
that critical split in the negative forms, the one between giving a choice and stating

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,359
a flat-out prohibition.

64
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:41,079
So let's end with this thought. This grammar stuff, it isn't just about passing a test,

65
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,399
right? It's about understanding the difference between obligation and choice in your own

66
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,519
life. So, what's one thing you don't have to do, but you choose to do anyway?

67
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,399
Thanks for joining me today.
