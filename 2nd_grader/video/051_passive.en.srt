1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
All right, today we're going to crack the
code on a really powerful tool in English
grammar,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,480
the passive voice. And I promise by the
end of this you'll see it's not some
confusing rule

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,920
to memorize. No, it's actually a kind of
superpower that lets you decide who the
real hero of your

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,040
sentences. So let's dive right in. Okay,
so take a look at these two sentences. The
teacher

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,080
praised her and she was praised by the
teacher. On the surface they pretty much
say the same

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
don't they? But there's a really important
difference here, in the focus.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,080
It's like the spotlight shifts from one
person to the other.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,080
And that difference really just boils down
to one simple question.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Who's the hero of the story? In that first
sentence, the hero is clearly the teacher.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,080
But in the second one, the hero is her.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,080
The action is exactly the same, but the
main character, totally different.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
And you know what? That's the whole point.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,080
It's all about choosing who or what you
want to put in the spotlight.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,560
And the tool that lets you make that
choice,

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,280
the thing that lets you change the hero of
your sentence,

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,240
well, that's what we call the passive
voice. So what is it really?

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,600
At its heart, the passive voice just means
to be done.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,640
You hear it all the time, cheese is made,
the song was sung.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
See how that works? The structure takes
the focus off the person

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,440
doing the action and puts it right onto
the person

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
or thing that's receiving the action.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,480
So that covers the what and the why,

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,200
but how do you actually build one of these
sentences yourself?

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,040
Well, the good news is it's way simpler
than you might think.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,060
There's a basic formula, and once you know
it, you've got it.

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,900
Let's take a look. And here it is.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,920
This is basically the secret code to the
whole thing.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,160
It's just two little parts, a form of the
verb to be, you know,

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,160
like is, are, was, or were,

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,960
and then you add something called the past
participle. That's it.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,520
Let's see how this actually works in
practice.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,720
So in the present tense, we'd say, they
speak English.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,000
In the past, they spoke English, simple
enough.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,360
But to make it passive,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
we need that special third form of the
verb, spoken.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
We just pair it with is and we get,
English is spoken there.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,880
Now, this is super important, so I really
want this to sink in.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,640
This is the number one trap people fall
into.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,360
The name past participle is a little
confusing

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,480
because it has absolutely nothing to do
with the past tense.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,560
Just think of it as the special verb form

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,860
you need for the passive voice. That's a
toll job.

43
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,980
Okay, so you can probably see that getting
the hang

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,580
of these past participles is the most
important step.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,500
And the great news is they basically fall
into two very clear groups,

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,860
the regular ones and the irregular ones.

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,820
Let's start with the easy stuff, okay?
We'll call this level one.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,140
These are the regular verbs and trust me,

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,380
they're gonna be your best friend

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,020
when you're just starting to figure this
out.

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,700
And here's why they're so easy. For almost
all regular verbs,

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,040
The past tense form and the past
participle form are exactly the same.

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,180
They just end in ed. Paint, painted,
painted.

54
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,480
Wash, washed, washed. So if you already
know the past tense,

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,920
you already know the participle. See?
Simple.

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,500
All right, feeling pretty good about that?
Let's level up.

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,140
It's time for the boss level, the
irregular verbs. But don't worry,

58
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,540
they're not nearly as scary as they sound.
Now these are the ones

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,380
where you do have to memorize a new form.
So, speak, spoke, spoken.

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,780
Take, took, taken. Break, broke, broken.

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,860
But hang on, look closely. Do you see a
pattern here?

62
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,380
A lot of these end with that Ian sound.

63
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,940
That's a great little clue to listen for.

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,660
So, what's the best way to get these
locked into your brain?

65
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,940
Honestly, the best advice is the simplest.
Just practice them.

66
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,420
Say them out loud. Speak, spoke, spoken.
Write, wrote, written.

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,780
Write them down a few times.

68
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,020
that repetition really builds a kind of
muscle memory.

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,980
Okay, let's do a quick practice round. The
song is loved.

70
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,860
Yep, that's a regular one, easy.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,780
The vase was broken, that's a regular.

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,620
How about the photo was taken? And
finally, Spanish is spoken.

73
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,380
See, you're already getting the hang of
it. Fantastic.

74
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,820
So now you've got the basic building
blocks down.

75
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,900
Let's add two more essential skills to
your toolkit,

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,820
how to make negative sentences, and how to
ask questions.

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,500
Making a passive sentence negative could
not possibly be easier.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,300
Seriously, all you do is find that B verb,
in this case it's is,

79
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,140
and you just stick the word not right
after it. That is it.

80
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,160
You don't change anything else.

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,820
And asking a question, it's just as
simple.

82
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,500
You take your sentence, you find that same
B verb,

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,100
and you just move it to the very front of
the sentence.

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,460
English is spoken becomes is English
spoken?

85
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,100
The word order is the whole trick.

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,980
Answering these questions is a total
breeze too.

87
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,900
You just respond using that same B verb.
Is English spoken?

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,740
Yes, it is. Is cheese made from milk? No,
it isn't.

89
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,060
Super simple and direct. Okay, let's pull
back for a second

90
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,100
and just recap everything we've covered

91
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,940
because you haven't just learned some
boring grammar rule.

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,860
You've actually gained a new communication
superpower.

93
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,220
It really all comes down to these four
steps.

94
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,620
Number one, the formula is always B plus
the past participle.

95
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,660
Number two, get comfortable with the
regular

96
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,140
and irregular participles. Three, to make
it negative, just add not.

97
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,820
And four, to ask a question, just move the
B verb to the front.

98
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,300
That's the entire system right there.

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,540
And this takes us right back to where we
started.

100
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,360
Remember these two sentences?

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,060
Now the difference is perfectly clear,
isn't it?

102
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,440
One sentence is about John and the other
is about Jennifer.

103
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,780
You are the one in control of the focus.
you get to choose your hero.

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,660
You've got the keys now. You know how to
build these sentences,

105
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,800
how to make them negative, and how to turn
them into questions.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,380
So really, there's only one thing left to
ask.

107
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,860
Now that you know the secret,

108
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,420
who's gonna be the hero of your next
sentence?
