1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's talk about one of those small words that does a ton of heavy lifting in the English

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
language.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,180
It's a word you probably use, I don't know, dozens of times a day without even thinking

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
about it.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,760
But what if I told you that really mastering this one simple word could make your speaking

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,240
and writing so much clearer, so much more sophisticated?

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,620
Well today, we're going to unlock the power of when.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,320
So to really see the power of when in action, let's start with a really simple problem.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,719
Just imagine we have two separate moments in time, two different ideas that we want

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,719
to connect.

11
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,840
Okay, here's our first moment.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,680
A simple, complete idea, right?

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,560
I was watching television.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,040
This sentence, it stands perfectly fine all on its own.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,439
It tells us exactly what was going on.

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,980
And then, boom, here's our second moment, also a totally complete idea.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,980
He came.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,980
An action happened.

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,680
But right now, these are just two separate facts.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,759
One thing happened, and then another thing happened.

21
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,580
They're not really connected.

22
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,799
So this is the big question for today.

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,200
How can we link these two separate events together into one single flowing thought?

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,360
How do we show that they're actually related in time?

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,059
Now our first instinct, you know, might be to just grab a simple word to show that these

26
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,279
two things happen around the same time.

27
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:14,040
Let's see what that looks like.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,720
We could say, I was watching television then.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,440
Or maybe something like, I was watching television at that time.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
And you know what?

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
This works.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,639
It totally gets the point across.

33
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:26,379
But it feels a little clunky, doesn't it?

34
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,900
The ideas still kind of feel like two separate sentences that we just shoved next to each

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
other.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,059
We can do better.

37
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,860
And this, my friends, brings us to our hero word for the day.

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,559
This is the elegant solution that can seamlessly merge these two ideas into one fluid, really

39
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,459
sophisticated sentence.

40
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,940
Let's bring in when.

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,019
Ah, just look at that.

42
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,220
I was watching television when he came.

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,699
See how that just flows?

44
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,620
It's not two separate events anymore.

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,419
It's one single story.

46
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,699
That little word, when, acts like the perfect glue, binding these two moments together.

47
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,139
So what's the magic trick here?

48
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:06,180
Well, that little phrase, when he came, it acts as a single unit.

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,900
It's basically a package deal.

50
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,880
When grabs a subject, in this case, he, and a verb, came, and turns the whole thing into

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,460
a super precise description of a moment in time.

52
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,899
It literally means, at the time that he came.

53
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:23,339
Okay, so now that we know what when is doing, let's talk about a pro tip for how to use

54
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,339
it.

55
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,339
When isn't just powerful, it's also really flexible.

56
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:28,820
You've got options.

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,919
Now what's really cool is that you have two perfectly correct ways to build this sentence.

58
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,979
You can stick the when part at the end, like I was sleeping when he came.

59
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,619
Or if you want to switch things up, you can lead with it.

60
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,500
When he came, I was sleeping.

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,100
Both are 100% correct, and they mean the exact same thing.

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,600
But, and this is a big but, there is one critical rule you absolutely cannot forget.

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,279
If you choose to put that when clause at the very beginning of your sentence, you

64
00:02:56,279 --> 00:03:01,240
must, must, must separate it from the main idea with a comma.

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,800
That tiny little comma is doing some serious work there to keep your sentence clear and

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
easy to read.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,199
Don't forget it.

68
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,679
Alright, time to put this into practice.

69
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,600
Here's a quick challenge for you.

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,119
Unscramble the words you see in the parentheses to finish the sentence.

71
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:19,000
Go on, I'll give you a second to think about it.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,259
And there you have it.

73
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,259
My mother was a good tennis player when she was young.

74
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:27,660
That when clause just neatly connects her tennis skill to a specific time in her life.

75
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,699
Perfect, you got it.

76
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,380
So now it's time to pull back the curtain a little bit and reveal what's really going

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,460
on here from a grammar perspective.

78
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,179
What is the true identity of this super flexible, super useful word?

79
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,940
Let's ask the big question.

80
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,779
We know it connects ideas, sure, but what do we actually call a word that does that?

81
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,960
What's its official job title in the world of grammar?

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,119
The real key here is that when isn't just connecting random words, it's connecting

83
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:57,240
two complete ideas, or what we call clauses.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,779
We have, I was watching television, that's a subject and a verb.

85
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:04,720
And we have, he came, that's another subject and another verb.

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,880
When is the bridge that connects them.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,179
And any word that does this job has a special name, it's a conjunction.

88
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:13,220
So that's the secret identity.

89
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,980
In this sentence, when is acting as a conjunction, joining two complete thoughts.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,220
You already know other conjunctions like and, but, and so.

91
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,380
Well, when is just another powerful member of that same family.

92
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,220
So let's just do a quick recap of our journey, right?

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,899
We started with a simple adverb, then, which felt a littleâ€¦ disconnected.

94
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,299
Then we upgraded to using when as a conjunction to create a single flowing sentence.

95
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:40,859
And finally, we mastered its flexibility, learning we can even move it to the front

96
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:43,540
of the sentence as long as we use that comma.

97
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,420
Pretty cool how we went from a simple word to a powerful grammatical tool.

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,779
So I'll leave you with a little something to think about.

99
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,260
In the sentence, I was sleeping when he came, which part feels like the main event?

100
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
The sleeping?

101
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,579
Or his arrival?

102
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,119
And what about if you flip it?

103
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,899
When he came, I was sleeping.

104
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,459
Does that change which part feels more important?

105
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,779
That's the subtle power these little words have.

106
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,500
Keep exploring.
