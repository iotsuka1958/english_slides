Hi, Jane. Do you like sports?
Not really, but I enjoy reading. How about you?
I like tennis. Itâ€™s my favorite sport. Let's play tennis this weekend!
That sounds fun, but I also want to read a new book. Let's read together after playing.
Great idea! Let's meet at the park at 10 in the morning.
Perfect! I'll bring the book.
