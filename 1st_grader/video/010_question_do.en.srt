1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey everyone and welcome! Are you ready?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,440
Because today we're going on a quest, a
question quest.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,920
So let's kick things off with a question
for you.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,080
Do you like baseball?

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,760
See, asking questions in English, it's
like having a superpower.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,360
And today, we're going to unlock it
together.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Alright, first up on our quest, it's level
1.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,600
And here we're going to meet our heroes,
the Dew Crew.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, so picture this. Your friend says to
you, you play the guitar.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
That's just a statement, right?

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,760
But what if you want to ask them if it's
true?

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
How do we flip that into a question? It's
super easy.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,040
It's like a two-step magic recipe.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,240
First, you just pop the magic word do
right at the beginning.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,880
Then step two, you stick a question mark
at the end.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,440
That's literally it. And voila! Do you
play the guitar?

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
See how simple that was? You've already
got the basic pattern down.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
Great job!

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,320
Now this do rule, it works perfectly
whenever you're talking about I, you, we,
or they.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,280
Think of them as a team, right? The do
crew.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,800
If one of them is the star of your
sentence, do is the word you need.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,680
Okay, ready to try another one? Let's take
a look.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,200
We've got they speak French. Okay, so they
is in our crew.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,720
You know what to do, right? Yes, that's
it. Do they speak French?

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
See, you just put do at the front,

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,600
a question mark at the end, perfect.
You're getting so good at this.

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,440
And just like that, level one is complete.
You are a total natural.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,320
But are you ready for a bigger challenge?

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,720
It's time for the boss level. All right,
here we go, boss level.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,900
This is where we learn how to master the
word does.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,800
Now does is a little different, a little
trickier,

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,880
but super important. Okay, here's our
challenge. He sings well.

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,760
Now look closely, what do you see?

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,560
That little S on the end of sings, that's
our clue.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,440
It's a secret signal telling us, Hey, the
rules are about to change.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Yeah, that S is like a special power-up

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,920
that the verb gets when we're talking
about he, she, or it.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,800
You might hear your teacher call it the
third person singular,

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,380
but let's just call it the special S rule.

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,200
It's the key to this boss fight. So let's
think about this.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,680
For they speak, we used do, easy.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,360
But now we have he sings with that special
S.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,640
So doesn't it make sense that we need a
special question word too?

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,080
What do you think it is? The hero for this
tough job is does.

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,720
Check it out. Does is really just do with
that special S power up

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,480
already built right in. Pretty cool, huh?

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,520
So the correct question is, does he sing
well?

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,320
But wait a second, hold on, take a really
close look.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,940
What happened to the S on the verb sings?
It disappeared?

50
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,900
Okay, this right here, this is the boss's
number one trick.

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,540
So many students fall into this trap and
say,

52
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,980
does he sings well, but not you, uh-uh,

53
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,460
because I'm gonna let you in on the secret

54
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,660
to beat this boss every single time. Okay,
listen up,

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,760
because this is the most important part.

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,900
You only need one S, that's it. That's the
whole secret.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,220
The word does already has the S. It's
carrying all the power.

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,900
So the verb sings doesn't need its S
anymore.

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,580
It goes back to its simple form, sing.

60
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Just remember, one S is all you need.

61
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,260
And boom, boss level defeated. That was
amazing work.

62
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,180
All you have to do is remember that one
simple trick.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,220
Does has the S and you will never lose
this battle.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,040
Whew, mission complete.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,460
Your quest is done and you've got a brand
new skill.

66
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,220
Let's do a super quick review just to make
sure that new superpower

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,740
is locked in for good. All right, pop quiz
time, ready?

68
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,700
The sentence is, I have enough time. Go.

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,820
How do you turn that into a question?

70
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,700
And the answer is, do I have enough time?
Exactly.

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,020
I as part of the do crew, so we just use
do. Easy peasy.

72
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,560
And this right here, this is your
superpower summary.

73
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,580
Think of it as your secret map for asking
questions.

74
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,540
All you do is, one, check the subject.

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,500
Two, pick your champion, do or does?
That's the whole game plan.

76
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,540
You guys did such a fantastic job today.

77
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,580
You've seriously unlocked a new power in
your English skills.

78
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,780
And remember, every single time you
practice

79
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,300
asking a question, you're leveling up. So
keep practicing.

80
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,100
It's okay to make mistakes, really. That's
how we get better.

81
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,300
So I'm gonna leave you with one last
challenge.

82
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,140
Go take this new skill you learned and use
it today.

83
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,180
I know you can do it.

84
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,660
So what question are you gonna ask in
English today?
