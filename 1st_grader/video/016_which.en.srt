1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Alright, welcome to the Ultimate Choice
Challenge.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,200
Today, we're going to tackle one super
useful English word.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
Think of it like a new superpower for
asking awesome questions.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,800
You ready? Okay, first up, the ultimate
question. Cats or dogs?

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,360
It's a huge debate, right? Everyone has an
opinion.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,920
Well, life is packed with choices just
like this.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
And today, we're going to learn the
perfect word for asking about them.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
And that magic word is... Witch!

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
Now, I know in Japanese you've got dōtra
for two things and dōrei for three or
more,

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,540
but get this. In English, it's way easier.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,400
We just use which for everything.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,080
Whether it's two choices or twenty, which
is the word you need?

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,280
Alright, time to start the challenge.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,760
Welcome to level one, the basic choice.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,960
We're going to keep it simple and focus on
questions using the word is.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,980
Let's do this! See how easy that is?

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,140
It doesn't matter how many things there
are.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,720
If you see two bags, you can ask, which is
Ken's bag?

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,880
If you see a whole bunch of pencils, you
just ask, which is your pencil?

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,040
Same word every time. So simple, right?

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
And this works for bigger groups too. You
know, like the four seasons?

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,720
We've got spring, summer, fall, and
winter.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,000
So if you want to ask your friend to pick
their favorite, what do you say?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,160
You got it. Which is your favorite season?

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,920
Now what if you want to give someone
specific choices? Easy.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,640
You just add or at the end.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,680
Which is your favorite color? Pink or
blue? It's super direct and people use it
all the time.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,840
Awesome work on level one. You're crushing
it. But are you ready for level two? It's
time for

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,360
the action choice. This is where we learn
how to ask about choices that involve
doing stuff,

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,520
using our little helper words do and does.
So how do we build these questions?

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Let's break it down. You start with a
basic sentence, like, you like summer.
Simple enough.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,800
To make it a yes-no question, you pop do
at the front, do you like summer?

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,480
But now, to ask about a choice, you just
swap out summer for our hero word, which,
and put

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,680
it at the very beginning, so it becomes
which do you like?

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,760
So here's the secret recipe, you ready?

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,000
Just remember this simple formula.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,660
Start with which, then add do or does.

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,320
After that comes the person, you, she,
they, whatever.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,560
the action word, like, need, eat.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,880
And you finish it off with a question
mark. Boom!

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,680
A perfect question every time.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Okay, let's try it out with something you
know very well, school subjects.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Which do you like? English or math? See?

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,240
It's that same A or B thing we just talked
about. Easy peasy.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,480
Here's another one. Which does she eat for
breakfast? Cereal or toast?

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,520
And speaking of cereal, this is a perfect
window into American culture.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,000
Seriously, if you walk into a supermarket
in the US, there's literally an entire
aisle,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,480
a whole row just for cereal, hundreds of
boxes.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,880
So yeah, you're definitely going to need
the word which to survive breakfast.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,300
Okay, you've mastered the basics. You've
handled the action questions.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,480
It is time to power up for level three,
the pro level question.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,640
This is a really cool trick to make your
questions sound even more natural.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,440
All you do is add a noun right after
which.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
So let's look at the difference.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,400
You could ask, which do you like, tea or
coffee?

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
And that's totally fine. Nothing wrong
with it. But check this out.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,160
Which drink do you like, tea or coffee?
See that?

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,800
By adding the word drink, you're telling
the person exactly what category you're
talking

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,920
about. It's a tiny change, but it makes
you sound super clear.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,060
So here's the big rule for this level.

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,020
Which and the noun that comes after it are
like best friends.

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,120
They stick together always.

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,640
Think of them as one single piece, one big
question word.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,920
And that piece always goes at the start of
the sentence.

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Let's try another one.

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,480
Instead of just saying which do you like,
you can get more specific.

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,360
Which subject do you like, music or art?
So much clearer, right?

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
It just sounds a little more pro. Wow! You
did it!

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,160
You battled through level 1, 2, and 3.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,440
But now, you must face the final boss, the
Recap Challenge.

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,720
It's time to review all the awesome skills
you've just unlocked.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,880
Okay, think of this as your ultimate cheat
sheet.

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,720
We've got everything right here.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,480
We started simple with which is, right?

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,640
Then we learned how to add choices with a
or b.

76
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,320
After that, we leveled up to action
questions with do and does.

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,920
And finally, we hit the pro level by
adding a noun after which to get super
specific.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,200
So to wrap things up, I've got one last
question for you.

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,920
Using that pro level skill we just
learned, it's about two sports that are
huge in

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,680
Japan and in America. Ready?

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,640
Which sport do you like, baseball or
basketball? See?

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
You've totally got this.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,160
You now have all the power you need to ask
about any choice you can think of.

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,240
Amazing job today. Now go out there and
start asking some questions.
