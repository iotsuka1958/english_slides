1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey everyone and welcome! Get ready
because today we are firing up an amazing
machine for an adventure

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
into the past. We're going to master
something called the simple past tense and
trust me it's

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,600
actually a lot of fun. Let's do this! So
let me ask you something. Think about
yesterday or maybe

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,280
last weekend. Did you play an awesome new
video game? Binge watch a cool anime? How
do you tell

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,440
your friends about all that cool stuff in
English? You know how do you share the fun
things that

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,800
that have already happened. Well, to tell
those awesome stories,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,480
you need a very special power.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
You need to become a time traveler,
seriously.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
You've got to send your verbs, your action
words back in time.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,780
And today I'm giving you the keys

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,060
to the incredible machine that can do just
that.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,480
That's right, say hello to the verb time
machine.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,080
Think of this as your official user
manual.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,360
By the time we're done here,

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
you are going to be a master time traveler

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
ready to tell any story from your past.
Okay, so check this out.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Our first trip to the past is actually
super simple.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
Right now, in the present, you might say,
I play tennis.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
But what about yesterday? Look at the
right.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,460
All we did was add ED to the end of play.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,400
So it becomes, I played tennis yesterday.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
That little ED is the main button on our
time machine.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
So let's zoom in on that main control.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,840
This is like the big, giant, easy to press
button

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,040
on the whole machine. It's the basic
stopped button.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,560
And you're gonna be using this one a lot.

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,600
Now this button is your new best friend

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,000
because it works on what we call regular
verbs.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,480
And the great news is most verbs in
English are regular.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,640
So if we're pretty much most of your time
traveling,

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
all you have to do is slap an ED on the
end of the verb

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,160
and bam, instant time travel. You're in
the past, it's that easy.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,880
Let's see it in action.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,060
Think about a classic American 4th of July
barbecue.

35
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,960
You could say, he cooked hamburgers. Or
what about after school?

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
She walked to the library.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,080
And last night, they watched the Super
Bowl on TV.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,320
See, cook, walk, watch.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,400
All they needed was that ED to jump into
the past.

40
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay, you've got the main power button
down. Feeling good?

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,200
Ready to level up? Because now we're
moving on

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,360
to the pro-gamers special settings.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
This is for all you expert time travelers
out there

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
who wanna handle the trickier situations.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
So our time machine has three special
settings for spelling.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,520
We've got one for verbs that already end
in E,

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
another for verbs that end in the letter
Y,

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,760
and a final pro tip for short verbs like
stop.

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't worry, they're super easy once you
see the pattern.

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,080
All right, setting number one. This one is
just common sense, really.

51
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,760
If a verb already ends in the letter E,
like the words like or use,

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,240
well, you don't need to add another E,
right? That would be silly.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,520
So you just add the D, that's it.

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,800
Like becomes liked and use becomes used,
super efficient.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,240
Now what about verbs that end in Y? This
one has two different paths

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,160
And it all depends on the letter that
comes right before the Y.

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,400
So if it's a consonant, like the D in
study, you do a little switch.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
You change the Y to an I and add ED. So
study becomes studied.

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,800
But if the letter before Y is a vowel, you
know, AEIOU,

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,440
like the A in play, you just do the normal
thing. You add ED.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,860
Play becomes played. And here it is, our
final pro tip.

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,800
This is for those short little verbs like
stop or plan.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,520
See that pattern? Consonant, vowel,
consonant, S-T-O-P.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,740
When you see that pattern,

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,680
you double the last letter before adding
E-D.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,780
So stop becomes stopped with two P's.

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,160
It's a small trick, but it's what makes it
sound right.

68
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,240
Okay, you've mastered the main button.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,360
You've unlocked the pro gamer settings.

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,120
You're feeling pretty confident, right?
Well, hold on.

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,160
There's one more part to this time
machine.

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,760
A hidden level, a secret, warp zone.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,340
You see, some verbs, they're just rebels.

74
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,760
They don't play by the rules.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,220
They look at that ED button and they're
like, nope, not for me.

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,640
These verbs have their own secret portals
to jump into the past.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,740
We call these guys irregular verbs.

78
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,960
Okay, let's open the top secret files.
Check these out.

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,400
Go doesn't become good, no way.

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,340
It warps into went, like I went to the
movies.

81
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,160
Eat completely changes into ate.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
She ate a huge slice of New York pizza.

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,580
You see, they totally transform.

84
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,780
You just gotta learn their secret
identities.

85
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,440
And there are more, see, become saw.

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,960
Get turns into got, like I got a new comic
book last week.

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,660
Speak becomes spoke. Yeah, you do have to
memorize these,

88
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,660
but think of them like special cheat codes
in a video game.

89
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,160
Once you know them, your English level
goes way up.

90
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,400
And just like that, you've done it,
training complete.

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,160
You've explored every button, every
special setting,

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,740
and every secret portal in the verb time
machine.

93
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,980
So before I send you off on your first
mission,

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,760
let's do a quick final check. So just
remember the controls.

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,960
Your main power is just adding EED.

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,480
Use your pro settings when you see verbs
ending in E or Y.

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,840
And for those rebel verbs,

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,080
jump into the secret warp zone and use
their special forms.

99
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,240
You have all the tools you need. So I'm
gonna ask you one more time.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,460
What did you do yesterday? What's a great
story you can tell?

101
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,980
Did you study for a test? Did you go to
the park?

102
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,460
Did you see a friend? Now you can actually
say it.

103
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,420
You are now a fully licensed time
traveler.

104
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,580
You have the power to share your past and
tell your stories.

105
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,420
So go on, your first mission starts now.
Good luck out there.
