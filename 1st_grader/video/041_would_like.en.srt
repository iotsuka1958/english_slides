00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, and welcome. Today, we are
going to unlock a phrase that's basically
a social

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,480
superpower in English. Seriously, it's
super simple, but it's so powerful, and
it's going

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,000
to completely change how you communicate.
You ready? Let's jump right in.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First things first, let's talk about a
word you use all the time. Want. It's
probably

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,320
one of the very first English words you
learned, but have you ever kind of worried
that

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,840
it might sound a little rude sometimes?
Let's figure out why picking the right

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,420
That word is so, so important. Okay,
picture this.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,800
You walk into a pizza shop in America.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,680
You're super hungry and you go up to the
counter and say, I want a pizza.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,560
Now is that wrong? Well, not really,
they'll totally understand you.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,480
But it can sound a little demanding, you
know, almost like how a little kid might
talk to

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,520
their parents.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,520
With your best friend it's no big deal,
but in most other situations, we can do

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,200
way better. And this gets to a really huge
cultural point.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,700
In English-speaking countries, especially
in the US, being polite in just normal,
everyday

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,180
situations is a really big deal.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,860
It's all about showing respect, and
choosing the right words doesn't just make
you sound

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,900
polite. It makes you sound more mature and
way more confident.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,420
So what's the secret then?

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,980
How can you ask for something without
sounding a little bit rude or like a
little kid?

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,100
Well, it is time to reveal the magic
phrase that will instantly level up your
English

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,260
skills. And here it is, folks, I would
like.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,860
These three little words are about to
become your new best friend.

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,180
Instead of saying, I want, you just say, I
would like.

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,940
Just like that, you turn a demand into a
polite, respectful request.

26
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,300
And you sound so much more thoughtful.
It's awesome.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,140
So here's the deal. I want is direct. It's
casual.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,940
It's perfect for your family or your super
close friends.

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,260
But I would like, now that's polite and
respectful.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,460
This is what you're going to use with
teachers, people working in shops, new
friends, pretty

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,340
much everybody else. It is always a safe
and really smart choice.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,420
So you could say, I would like some water,
or I would like some flowers.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,940
But hey, look at that middle example, I'd
like a sandwich.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,460
In real everyday conversation, native
speakers almost always shorten I would to
I'd.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,580
It just sounds so much more natural.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,620
So practice saying I'd like, and trust me,
you're going to sound like a pro.

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
Okay, awesome.

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,780
So you've totally mastered asking for
things, but what about asking people to do
something

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,940
with you? You know, like inviting them
somewhere.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Well, I've got good news. Your new
superpower works for that, too.

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,900
Let's think of a new situation.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,740
Okay, it's your birthday, you're planning
an awesome party.

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,060
You want to invite a friend, what's the
first thing that pops in your head to say?

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,780
You might say this, do you want to come to
my party?

45
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,900
And you know what? That is perfectly fine.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,460
It's clear, it's super common, and it's a
great way to invite a friend.

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
So don't worry.

48
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,380
saying it wrong at all. But hey, since
we're here to level up our skills, let's
take that

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,500
good sentence and make it even better.
Let's make it sound more welcoming, more
thoughtful.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,540
Just a little more special.

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,380
And this is how you do it. Would you like
to come to my party? Ah, can you just feel

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,900
the difference? It feels warmer, right?
More polite. It makes the invitation feel
like

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,540
a really special offer. This is the
absolute gold standard for invitations. So
to wrap

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,220
that up, do you want is a casual offer.
It's great for your best buddies. But
would you like?

55
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,540
That's a polite invitation and it's
perfect for absolutely everyone. A new
classmate,

56
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,700
a teacher, you name it. It always works.

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,940
All right, there is one last really
powerful way to use this phrase. It's not
just for asking

58
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,900
for stuff or for inviting people. You can
also use it to talk about something really
important,

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,100
your own goals and your dreams. See, when
you're talking about actions you want to
do,

60
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,860
you use the structure I would like to and
then you add a verb.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,860
This is the perfect way to share your
ambitions or what you're planning to do
and it sounds

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,500
really thoughtful and mature. For example,
you can use it for your biggest dreams
like

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,700
I'd like to visit London someday or for
something simple like I'd like to play
tennis this weekend.

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,020
It works for anything you hope to do and
it's just a fantastic way to talk about
your interests.

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,140
Okay, let's try building a sentence
together real quick. If we follow the path
on the

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,460
the screen, we get, would you like to go
to the zoo with us?

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Perfect, see?

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,700
You're already building these powerful,
polite sentences.

69
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,520
It's that easy. Phew, we've covered a lot,
so let's bring it all home.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,900
This is your final review so you know
exactly when to use Want and when to use
your brand

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,040
new superpower, would like. But wait,
first a quick pro tip.

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,100
When native speakers say want to really
fast, it often sounds like wanna.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
Like I wanna watch a movie.

74
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,380
It is super, super common when you're
talking with friends.

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,480
But remember this, this is only for
speaking, never ever write wana on an
English test or

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,640
in your homework. It'll just be our little
secret, okay?

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,320
So here it is, your ultimate cheat sheet.

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,720
Whether you're asking for a pizza or
inviting someone to a movie, the rule is
always the

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
same.

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,980
For casual times with your family and
close friends, I want and do you want to
are

81
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,240
totally fine.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,440
But for pretty much every other situation,
your superpower is I would like for things

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,280
And would you like to for actions and
invitations?

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,840
It really is that simple. And that's a
wrap.

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,920
You've now have the key to sounding more
polite,

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,520
more mature, and way more confident in
English.

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
So my final question for you is,

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
now that you have this social superpower,

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
how are you gonna go out there and use it?

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,280
Thanks so much for hanging out with me
today.
