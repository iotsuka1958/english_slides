1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Hey everyone, and welcome!

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,120
Ever find yourself wanting to say no in
English, but you're not 100% sure how.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,480
It's one of those super important skills,
but it has a couple of little tricks, so
let's

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,120
dive in and finally master how to make
negative sentences.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Alright, let's start with the simple,
positive sentence that I think pretty much
all of

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,560
us can get behind. I like coffee.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,480
It's clear, it's direct, and it's going to
be our starting point for today.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,840
But what if you're one of those people
who, I don't know, doesn't like coffee?

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,460
How do you say the opposite?

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,900
You can't just stick the word not in there
somewhere. Or can you?

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,900
Well, that's the big question we're going
to solve right now.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,140
Okay, so to solve this puzzle, we're going
to need a little bit of help.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,400
And our new best friend is this phrase
right here, do not.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,740
This is the magic key that unlocks
negative sentences, especially when we're
talking

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,260
about actions. So how does this actually
work? It's super simple.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,780
Check it out. You start with your positive
sentence, right?

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,340
I play soccer.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,360
When you just drop our helper, do not,
right before the action verb, play.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,780
So you get, I do not play soccer.

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,780
And of course, in everyday conversations,
you'll almost always hear the shortcut, I
don't

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,780
play soccer. See? Easy.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,060
Okay, so you might be thinking, why all
the fuss?

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,300
Why can't I just throw the word not in
there?

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,940
And that is a great question.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,460
This is where things get a little tricky
for a lot of learners, because in English
we

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,020
actually have two different kinds of verbs
that follow two different rules.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,140
And this slide right here shows you
exactly why.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,900
On the left, you've got your B verbs. You
know, am, is, are.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,060
With these guys, it's easy. You just add
not after them.

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,460
I am hungry becomes I am not hungry. But
look at the right side.

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,820
For action verbs, things you do, like like
or play, that's when you need our helper

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,060
do not to go before the verb. The big
takeaway?

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,380
You have to figure out what kind of verb
you're working with first.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,480
Alright, you've totally got the main rule
down. Well one, complete.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
But there's a little twist.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,160
A special rule that only applies when
we're talking about he, she, or it.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,080
So in a normal positive sentence, when
your subject is he, she, or it, you
usually add

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,560
an S to the end of the action verb.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,840
You don't say he live in Paris, you say he
lives in Paris.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,920
Now keep a close eye on that S, because
it's about to do something pretty cool.

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,380
And here's the magic trick.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,760
When we make the sentence negative, that
little s from lives actually hops over to
our helper

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,260
word do, and it turns it into does.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,860
So we get, he does not live in Paris.

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,940
The super important thing to remember here
is that the verb live goes back to its
original

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,820
form. That s moves, it doesn't get copied.

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,660
So saying he does not lives, nope, that's
a common mistake, but it's incorrect.

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,340
Okay, enough talk, right?

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,700
Theory is one thing, but practice is where
it really sticks.

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,100
So let's do a quick tune up. I'm gonna
throw a few sentences at you,

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,580
see if you can get them right. You ready?

52
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,340
Okay, first one, they like horror movies.

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
How do you flip that into a negative?

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,980
Go on, take a second to think about it.
And boom, there it is.

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,020
They do not like horror movies.

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,980
Or if you're just chatting with friends,

57
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,380
they don't like horror movies. The subject
is they.

58
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,220
So it's just the standard do not rule. You
got this.

59
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,580
All right, let's step it up a notch a
little trickier this time.

60
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,220
Sue, play tennis on Sundays. Which one
fits?

61
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,140
Is not, do not, or does not? Think
carefully.

62
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,200
The winner is does not. And why is that?

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,060
Well, Sue is just like saying she, right?

64
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,420
And that triggers our special third-person
rule.

65
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Since play is an action verb, we need does
not. Awesome.

66
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,860
Okay, last challenge.

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,960
This one is to make sure everything is
clicked into place.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,200
He from New Zealand. What's the right
choice here?

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,760
Really think about the verb that would be
in the original sentence.

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,960
And the answer is, is not. Ha, did we
catch you?

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,520
This was a little test.

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,200
The full positive sentence would be he is
from New Zealand.

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,360
The verb is is, that's a B verb. And
what's our rule for B verbs?

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,440
We just stick not right after it. You guys
are nailing this.

75
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,520
Wow, you did an absolutely amazing job.

76
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,080
We've gone through the main rule, the
beaver of exception,

77
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
and that tricky third-person twist.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
So let's wrap it all up in a handy little
cheat sheet

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,840
you can use anytime you need it. And here
it is, your go-to guide.

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,800
This table breaks it all down.

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,960
All you have to do is ask yourself two
simple questions.

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,680
First, who's the subject? And second, what
kind of verb is it?

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
The answer tells you exactly what to do.

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,180
Use do not, does not, or just a plain old
not.

85
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,620
That's the whole system right there on one
screen.

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,420
So there you have it, you are now
officially equipped

87
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,220
to say no confidently in English. You can
disagree with someone,

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,980
you can state what you don't like, you can
correct information,

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,380
it's a really powerful skill to have.

90
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,980
And that just leaves us with one last
thing to think about.

91
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,900
Now that you know how to say no,

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,340
what are you gonna say yes to learning
next?

93
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,940
Thanks so much for joining me.
