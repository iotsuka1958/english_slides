1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
Hey everyone, and welcome.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,280
In this explainer, we are going to unlock
a total English superpower.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,000
How to talk about all the things you
didn't do. Ready?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's get into it.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Okay, let's start with a situation we've
all been in, right?

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,280
It's the end of the day, you're super
tired, and oops, you didn't do your
homework.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,240
But how do you say that in English?
Yesterday, I homework not do?

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,080
Eh, that doesn't sound quite right, does
it?

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, stick with me because by the end of
this, you'll know exactly how to say it.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
And trust me, it's way easier than you
think.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,520
Alright, let's start putting the pieces of
this puzzle together.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,200
First up, we've got to figure out the
right way to say you didn't do something
in the

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
past.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,100
Now to learn how to talk about the past,
we're actually going to start with
something

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,880
you probably already know really well, the
present tense.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,320
Think of this as a quick warm-up before we
totally level up your English game.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,240
So in the present tense, you've got to
remember two different words, right?

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,400
You use don't for I, you and they, but
then you have to switch over to doesn't
for he

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,280
and she. It can be kind of annoying to
keep track of both of them.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,120
But what if I told you that talking about
the past is actually easier?

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeah, for real.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,440
Forget about juggling two words, I'm about
to hand you a magic key that unlocks

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,940
everything.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,480
And that magic key is this one simple
word, didn't, boom, that's it.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,120
This one little word is going to do all
the heavy lifting for us whenever we talk
about

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
something that happened in the past. And
here's why it's so awesome.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,880
It doesn't matter who you're talking
about, I, you, he, she, they, it's always
didn't.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,700
Just one word for everybody.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,480
So much easier than don't and doesn't,
right?

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:48,580
Okay, now, like any powerful magic key,
there is one tiny secret role you have to
know to

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,980
use it correctly.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,500
So listen up, because this next part is
super, super important.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,680
So here's the secret.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,060
When you use didn't, the verb that comes
after it gets to just relax and go back to
its

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,900
original simple form. And why is that?

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,940
Well, it's because didn't is like the
superhero here.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,220
It's already doing all the work of showing
that we're talking about the past.

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's see how it works.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,740
You might say, I played tennis, and you've
got that ED on the end.

40
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,380
But once you bring in our magic word,
poof, I didn't play tennis.

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,180
See that? The ED just vanishes.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,600
Played goes right back to its original
form, play.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,260
And this works even for those super tricky
irregular verbs.

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
You know the ones.

45
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,860
So you could say he went to London, which
is a really popular city for Americans to

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,980
visit by the way.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,140
But if his plans changed, you'd say he
didn't go to London.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,460
Went just snaps right back to its original
form, go. Cool, huh?

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,140
Okay, everybody, listen up, because this
right here is the number one trap that
students fall into.

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,940
They'll say something like, he didn't
lived using both did and the ed ending.

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,220
But you are not going to make that
mistake, are you?

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,460
Nope, because now you know the secret
rule.

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,740
Didn't has all the power, so the verb
doesn't need to.

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,740
All right, you've got the magic word and
you know the secret rule.

55
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,420
Are you ready to take it for a spin?

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,860
Let's do a quick final check to make sure
you are a total didn't master.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,540
Okay, challenge number one. The sentence
is, I studied math last night. Now pay
attention to

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,780
how study changed to studied. How would
you make this sentence negative? Think
about the rule.

59
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,820
And the answer is, I didn't study math
last night. Yes, you nailed it. You
remembered that

60
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,300
studied has to go all the way back to its
base form study. Fantastic job.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,220
Next up, she walked to work. You know, if
she lives in a huge American city like New

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,020
New York, she probably didn't walk to
work.

63
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,700
Most people take the subway. So how would
you say it? You got it.

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,520
She didn't walk to work.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,980
The magic word didn't pops in and that
little ED from walked just completely
disappears.

66
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,660
It's really as simple as that.

67
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,160
Alright it is time for the final boss
challenge.

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,460
This one has an irregular verb which makes
it a little bit tougher.

69
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,000
The sentence is, we saw a great movie.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
So how do you make this one negative? And
there it is!

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,560
We didn't see a great movie!

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,320
Saw goes right back to its original form,
C. You did it!

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
You defeated the final boss!

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,840
You are officially a master of the past
tense negative.

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,560
So let's wrap this all up.

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440
When it comes down to it, the key takeaway
is just this one simple magic formula.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,240
To talk about what you didn't do in the
past, all you need is didn't plus the

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,920
original verb. That's it. That's the whole
secret.

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,280
And now, it's your turn to use your brand
new superpower. What's one thing you
didn't

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,760
do today? Maybe you didn't eat your
vegetables, or you didn't watch TV? Try
making a sentence

81
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,440
for yourself right now. Thanks so much for
hanging out with me, and I'll see you in

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,040
the next one.
