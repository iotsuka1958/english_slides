1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Hey, what's up everyone?

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,680
Are you ready to get a new superpower in
English? Seriously.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,640
Today, we're going to learn how to give
commands, you know, the kind of stuff you
hear all the

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,200
time in movies and video games. So let's
do this. Let's power up.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,400
So how do you say stuff like do this or
look in English?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,060
You hear it all the time, right?

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,900
Like in an action movie when the hero
yells go or in a video game when your
teammate

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,320
shouts look out.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
Well those are commands and today we're
going to figure out exactly how to use

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,400
them so you can sound super natural.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,640
Okay, first up, let's master what I like
to call the boss command.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,000
This is your basic Level 1 power-up for
giving direct, simple instructions.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,100
You know, just like a team captain or the
main character in a game telling their
squad

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,720
exactly what to do. And get this, the rule
is so, so simple.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,640
You just forget about subjects like I or
you for a second.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,680
All you have to do is start your sentence
with the main action word, the verb, in

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,840
its basic original form, like the form
you'd find in a dictionary.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,400
No ing, no s's at the end, nothing extra.
Just the verb itself.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,640
And check this out. This one simple rule
works for everything.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,160
For regular action verbs, what you might
call a ipandoshi, it's just, come here.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,520
Or stand up. Easy. But what about the
b-verb? Or b-doshi?

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,800
Well, you don't use am, is, or are. Nope.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,040
You just use its original base form, b. So
you get, be quiet.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,140
Be careful. See? Super simple, right?
Alright, time for a quick quiz.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,660
Let's test this out.

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,140
Imagine your friend is walking and they
don't see something on the floor.

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,440
They're about to trip. What do you yell?

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,880
Is it am careful, be careful, or is
careful?

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,760
Think back to that rule we just talked
about, the base form.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,160
And the answer is be careful. Yes, you got
it.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,720
For commands, you always, always use that
base form, B, awesome job.

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,680
Okay, so the boss command is super useful,
for sure.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,040
But let's be real, it can sometimes sound
a little, well, bossy.

34
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,200
So now it's time to level up our skill and
add a politeness boost.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,500
And all it takes is one simple magic word.

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,480
You guessed it, that magic word is please.

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,020
Now you've got two options here.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,360
You can stick it right at the beginning of
the sentence.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,500
Please sit down or you can pop it on the
end

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,360
But and this is a super important if if
you put it at the end you've got to add a
little comma right before it

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,720
So it's sit down, please. It seems like a
tiny detail, but trust me. It makes all
the difference

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay, fantastic. So you know how to tell
people what to do, but what about telling
them what not to do?

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Sometimes that's even more important,
right?

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,600
For that, you need the stop command. Think
of it as your defensive superpower.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,880
The secret weapon for this command is one
simple powerful word. Are you ready? It's
don't.

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,640
And guess what? The rule here is just as
easy as before. You literally just put
don't at the

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,880
very beginning of the sentence right
before that same base verb we've been
using. That's

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,040
That's it. You're done. And you can see,
this works for everything.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
In the hallway at school, don't run.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,960
In the movie theater, don't use your cell
phone here.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,920
And yeah, of course it works perfectly
with the B-verb too.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
In the library, a sign might say, don't be
noisy.

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,960
And what does your teacher always say?
Don't be late. See?

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,320
One simple rule covers them all.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,720
Alright, enough with now giving orders and
telling people what to do.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
I mean, that's not always fun, right?

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
So, what if you want to suggest doing
something together with your friends?

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
For that, we need the ultimate team-up
phrase.

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,160
So to invite someone to join in on the
fun, the magic word is let's.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,760
It's really just a short, cool way of
saying let us.

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
And the rule is, well, you can probably
guess it by now.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,040
You just start the sentence with let's and
follow it with yep, the base form of the

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
verb.

64
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,180
Okay, so maybe the school festival is
coming up and a great song comes on.

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,120
You can turn to your friends and say,
let's dance!

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,760
the lunch bell finally rings and your
stomach is rumbling. What do you say?
Let's eat lunch.

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
And when that final bell rings at the end
of the day, let's play basketball after
school.

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
It's just the perfect, most natural way to
make plans with your friends.

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,000
And hey, check it out. This also works
perfectly with the verb be. If you're in
the library,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,720
you and your friends might whisper, let's
be quiet. Or if you're doing a tricky
science

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,000
experiment, you'd say, let's be careful.
It's the best way to agree on how everyone
in the

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,280
than the group should act. You can even
say, let's be friends.

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,140
Okay, so you've unlocked the boss command,

74
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,580
the stop command and the team-up phrase.
You've got all the power-ups,

75
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,220
but I saved the biggest, most amazing
secret for last.

76
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,460
This is something that explains why all of
these commands

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,860
are so unique and so special. Okay, I want
you to look really closely

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,060
at a simple command sentence. Just stand
up.

79
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,740
Now think about it for a second.

80
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,740
what part of a normal English sentence
seems to be missing.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,180
I'm sure your English teacher has told you
this a million times.

82
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,640
Every English sentence needs a subject and
a verb, right?

83
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,580
Like I study or she plays tennis.

84
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,860
But in stand up, we've only got the verb
stand.

85
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,060
So where in the world is the subject? And
here it is, the big reveal,

86
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,020
the secret subject is you. That's right,
the subject is there,

87
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,520
but it's invisible. In every single
command sentence,

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,200
the subject is always automatically the
person you're talking to, you.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,960
So when you say stand up,

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,040
what your brain is really saying is you
stand up. Kinda cool, right?

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,620
And that is what makes these sentences so
powerful and so special.

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,380
They don't even need to say the word you

93
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,320
because it's already built right in. This
makes commands the fastest,

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,400
most direct way to communicate with
someone.

95
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,480
It's like a direct line to the person
you're talking to.

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,520
So there you have it. Your command power-
up is complete.

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,740
You can now give clear directions, make
polite requests,

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,520
warn a friend, and make awesome plans
together.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,360
It's a real communication superpower. So
my final question for you is,

100
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,760
now that you have it, how are you gonna
use it?
