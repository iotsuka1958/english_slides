1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey everyone, do you ever feel like your
English is kind of stuck on pause?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,280
You know, when you want to talk about
something that's happening right now,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,440
well today we are hitting the play button.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
We're going to put your English into live
action mode

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
by mastering something called the present
continuous.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
Ready? Let's dive in. So picture this.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,880
You're watching your favorite gamer
streaming live.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
They're in the middle of an epic boss
battle.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,480
Do they say, I defeat the boss? No way.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,520
They're yelling, I am defeating the boss.
Let's go.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
See, that's what we're talking about,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,500
that feeling of action happening in real
time,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,260
and that's exactly what we're gonna learn
how to do today.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,860
So what's the real difference here? Let's
break it down.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,340
On the left, they play baseball on
Sundays.

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,140
That's like a fact in a textbook, right?
It's their routine.

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,080
But on the right, they are playing
baseball now.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,100
Boom, suddenly you're right there at the
game.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,260
You can almost smell the popcorn. It's
happening this very second.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,860
That's the magic of live action English.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,100
All right, so how do we switch on this
live action mode?

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,820
It's actually super simple. There's a
secret formula, just two parts.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And trust me, once you get it, you'll
start seeing it everywhere.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,380
Let's check it out. And here it is, the
super secret formula.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,080
It's like a recipe with just two
ingredients.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,640
First, you need a B verb, that's your am,
is, or are.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,100
Then you add your main verb with ing,
tacked on the end.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,340
That's the whole thing.

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,260
But, and this is super important, you
gotta have both.

30
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,660
It's like you can't make a sandwich

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,380
with just one piece of bread, right? It
just doesn't work.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,060
Okay, you've got the formula.

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,140
Now it's time for a little pop quiz, a
mini challenge.

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,660
We're gonna focus on that first
ingredient, choosing the right B verb.

35
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,420
I'll give you a sentence with a blank
space

36
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,700
and you try to fill it in in your head.
You ready? Let's do this.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,660
All right, first one up. I blank reading a
book now.

38
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,660
What goes in the blank? Hmm, it's am.

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,420
Of course, I and Am are best friends. They
always stick together.

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,060
Easy, right? Next. Okay, how about this
one?

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,980
She blank singing a song now. We're
talking about one person.

42
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,060
So the B verb is, you got it.

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,140
It's is, she is, he is, my phone is.

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,340
If it's one person or thing, you use is,
perfect.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,100
And for our last one in this round, we
blank doing homework now.

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,620
This time it's a group of people. So it's
gotta be R, absolutely.

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,820
We are, they are, my friends are.

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,740
Look at that, you've already totally
mastered

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,700
the first half of our secret formula. Nice
work.

50
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,500
All right, part one is complete. You've
totally nailed the B verbs.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,900
Now let's level up to part two, adding
that ING at the end.

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,820
Most of the time it's super easy,

53
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,100
but there are a couple of pro-level
spelling tricks

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,660
you need to know to get it right every
time.

55
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,820
So check out this table, it makes
everything clear.

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,420
Rule number one, the standard one is a
piece of cake.

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,300
For most verbs like eat, you just slap an
ING on the end.

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,540
Bam, eating, so simple.

59
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,080
Rule two is for verbs that end with that
silent E, like make.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,140
All you do is say goodbye to the E and add
ING. You get making.

61
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,500
But then, then there's rule number three,
the special one.

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,540
Look at swim, it becomes swimming with a
double M.

63
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,740
So what's up with that? Why does that
happen?

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,880
Yeah, that's the big question, right?

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,380
That third rule is the one that trips
people up.

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,100
It feels kind of random. How in the world
are you supposed to know

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,920
when to double that last letter? Well,
guess what?

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,360
There's a secret, and it's actually not
about spelling.

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,920
It's about sound. Okay, listen closely
because the clue

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,840
is the vowel sound right before that last
letter.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,800
Let's take the word sit. Hear that IH
sound? Sit.

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,760
It's short, it's quick, right? Because
that vowel is short,

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,740
you double the T to get sitting. Now
compare that to eat.

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,420
Hear that e sound? Eat. It's a long,
stretched out sound.

75
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,220
And for long vowels like that, you just
add ing.

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,660
No doubling needed, so it becomes eating.
Isn't that cool?

77
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,380
Your ears tell you exactly what to do.

78
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,200
Wow, okay, you've got the formula, you've
got the spelling rules,

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,820
you are so close to being a master.

80
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,900
But now it's time for the final expert
level secret.

81
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,420
This is the one thing that even advanced
learners sometimes forget.

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,260
So let me ask you a question.

83
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Can you just take any verb in English and
add I-N-G to it?

84
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,860
Just throw it into live action mode? What
do you think?

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,460
The answer is nope, you can't.

86
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,660
And understanding why is gonna make your
English

87
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,580
sound so much more natural. Okay, look at
this.

88
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,280
On the left, he is playing the piano.
Yeah, that sounds perfect.

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,100
Playing is an action. You can see it, you
can hear it.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,620
But now look at the right side. He is
knowing Helen.

91
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,340
Oof, something about that just sounds
weird, doesn't it?

92
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,420
Your brain is telling you that's not
right.

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,620
And that's because no isn't an action.

94
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,380
It's a state, a condition you're in.

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,740
So basically, English has two kinds of
verbs.

96
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,180
You've got your action verbs.

97
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,100
These are the verbs that love to run
around

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,500
and be in live action mode. But then you
have state verbs.

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,820
And these verbs, well, they just like to
chill.

100
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,660
They're not about action. They're about a
state of being.

101
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,780
Verbs like no, like, have, or love.

102
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,060
You don't really do these things for a
short time.

103
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,900
It's just how things are. That's why they
don't like using ING.

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,780
Okay, final test, lightning round.

105
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,620
Let's see if you can pick the right one.

106
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,900
Number one, she eats or is eating
breakfast now.

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,020
Eating is an action, right? So it's is
eating, good.

108
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,420
Number two, he knows or is knowing the
answer.

109
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,820
No is a state verb, it likes to chill. So
we just say knows.

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,140
And the last one, we have or are having
two cats.

111
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,860
This is about having something,
possession, which is a state.

112
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,620
So the answer is have. You see the
pattern? You've totally got this.

113
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,340
You're a pro. And just like that, you're
in control.

114
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,960
You now have all the secret formulas, the
pro tips,

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,060
everything you need to use this grammar
perfectly.

116
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,820
Let's just do a super quick review of
everything you learned today.

117
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,060
So here's your final mission briefing.

118
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,100
First, you've got the formula B plus verb
ING

119
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,140
for anything happening right now.

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,120
Second, you know the three spelling rules,

121
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,320
even the tricky one about doubling the
letter.

122
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,520
And third, you have the ultimate pro tip.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Action verbs go live, but state verbs,
they just chill.

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
You know, we started this whole thing,

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,360
just try to figure out how to talk about
what's happening right now.

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
And now a sentence like, he is reading a
book now

127
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,760
is super easy for you. You can use that
with 100% confidence.

128
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,800
See, learning English can be pretty fun
when you know the secrets.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
So now it's your turn to go live.

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,760
I mean it, right now, stop and look around
you. What's happening?

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,480
Is the clock on the wall ticking? Are you
tapping your foot?

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,600
Is a car driving past your window?

133
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Find one thing, just one, that's happening
right now

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
and describe it in an English sentence.

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Put your new superpower to the test. You
can do it.

136
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Thanks so much for hanging out with me
today.
