1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Hey, welcome! Have you ever wanted to turn
a yes into a no in English but got a
little stuck?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
Well, today we're going to tackle exactly
that. Making negative sentences.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
And I promise you, it is so much easier
than you think. Let's dive in.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
So, think about it. It's easy to say, I am
hungry. But what if you're not?

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
How do you say that you don't want another
slice of cake? It seems like a small
thing,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
but getting this right is absolutely
essential for everyday conversations.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
And right here, you can see the difference
crystal clear.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,520
On the one hand, I am hungry is like
saying I equals hungry.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,240
But look at the other side, I am not
hungry.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Now it means I does not equal hungry.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,400
The whole meaning just flips all because
of one tiny, tiny change.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,280
So what's the secret?

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Well, it really all comes down to a single
super powerful word.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
This one little word is the key that's
going to unlock

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
Pretty much every negative sentence you
need when you're using the verb to be.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,440
And there it is. The magic word is simply
not. Yep, that's it.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,720
This small word does all the heavy lifting
for us.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,800
It's the secret ingredient we've been
looking for.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,200
So now let's take that magic word and turn
it into a simple,

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,120
solid rule that you can count on every
single time you use verbs like am,

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,400
is, and are. And check this out, it's just
three super simple steps.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,360
First, you spot the B verb.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,280
Second, you just drop the word not right
after it.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
And third, well, there is no third step.
That's it, you're done.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
Your sentence is officially negative. It
really is that easy.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,080
Let's see this in action, okay? So you
have you are from Canada.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,800
We find our verb, are. We put not right
after it and bam,

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,240
you are not from Canada, perfect. What
about for the verb is?

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Any different? Nope, it's the exact same
logic.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,120
she is a student becomes she is not a
student.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,080
The pattern just works every single time.
You can rely on it.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Let's do just one more to really lock it
in.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,480
What if it's plural, like they are busy?

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,160
Well, it transforms into you already know
it, they are not busy.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,120
One rule to cover them all.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,880
Okay, so you've totally got the basic rule
down.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,600
Now, if you wanna take it to the next
level

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,960
and sound way more natural and fluent,

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
You know, like you hear in movies and
songs,

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,400
we need to talk about a little pro tip,
contractions.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,360
So what in the world is a contraction?
It's really simple.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,320
It's just a shorter, faster, and much more
common way

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,320
of saying two words by kind of squishing
them together into one.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Now this is where it gets really cool.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,120
You often have more than one option. For
example, you are not busy

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,780
can be shortened in two different ways.
You can say you're not busy

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,640
or you can say you aren't busy.

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
And guess what? They're both totally
correct and used all the time.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,880
These two options actually come from two
different patterns. In the first one,

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,960
you combine the subject and the verb, so
you get something like she's not.

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,320
In the second one, you combine the verb
and the word not, which gives you she
isn't.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,920
But wait, there's one really, really
important exception you've got to
remember.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,240
While almost everything else gives you two
choices, I am not only has one
contraction.

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm not. Please be careful with this one
because I am and is a super common
mistake,

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,240
but it's just not used in standard
English. All right, that's enough talk.
You've got the rules,

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,560
you've got the pro tips. How about we put
your awesome new skills to the test right
now? You

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,880
ready? Okay, here's your first challenge.
How would you make this sentence negative?

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,760
The room is clean. Go ahead, take a second
and think about it. What are all the
different

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,560
ways you could say it. And times up. Here
are your answers. You could say the full
version,

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,200
the room is not clean, or you could use
the contractions, the room's not clean,

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,640
or the room isn't clean. If you got all
three of those, you are doing an amazing
job.

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,280
Let's keep this ball rolling. Ready for
the next one? Here it is.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
You are busy. How do you flip that one
into a negative? Again, think about all
the possible

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,000
ways to say it. And the answers are, you
are not busy, you are not busy, and you
aren't busy.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,360
See, you are totally getting the hang of
this. It's all just following that same
simple pattern.

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,640
Okay, let's wrap this all up nice and
neat. We're going to put everything we
just learned

67
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,720
together into one super handy reference
sheet. Like a little cheat sheet you can

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,520
look back on whenever you want. And here
it is. This table has got it all. On the
left,

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
you've got the full form. In the middle,
you see the first contraction pattern. And
on the right,

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,440
the second one. Just look. Everything has
two options except for our one special
case. I am not.

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,080
It only has one. This is your master key
right here. So look, if you only remember
one single

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,760
thing from our chat today, please let it
be this. To make a B verb negative, all
you ever have to

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,000
do is just add not right after it. That's
the foundation. Everything else we talked
about

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
just builds on top of that simple, simple
idea.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,040
And just like that, you've mastered a huge
piece of English grammar.

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,000
You took a problem, learned a simple rule,
and now you have the skills to use it with
confidence.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,920
You've proved that any part of English can
be broken down and understood.

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,920
So the only question I have for you is,
what are you going to master next?
