1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Hey there, ready for a quick grammar
workout?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,400
Today, we're going to master one of the
most useful words in English, when.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,920
We're going to figure out exactly how to
ask about time, dates, and schedules, so
you

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,200
can do it with total confidence. Let's
dive right in.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,080
So let's start with a classic. When is
your birthday?

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,520
It's a really simple, friendly question,
right?

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,600
But the way it's built, that's the key to
unlocking hundreds of other questions.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,840
By the end of this, you'll see the pattern
and you'll be able to ask this and so

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,640
so much more. All right, here's our game
plan for today.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,920
We'll start with how to ask when, then
we'll cover the two main rules.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,360
After that, we'll put it to the desk,
build up your time toolkit with some
vocabulary,

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,920
and wrap it all up with a handy cheat
sheet. Let's get to it!

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Okay, let's get to the core of it.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,520
Asking questions with when is actually
really systematic.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,400
It's not as tricky as you might think.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,540
There are really just two main patterns to
learn, and it all depends on the type

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,380
of verb you're using. Let's break them
down one by one.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,220
First up, let's talk about questions with
B verbs.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,460
You know, words like is and are.

20
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,700
It's a super simple three-step process.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,220
First, you start with a plain old
statement.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,220
Your birthday is August 7th.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,820
To make that a yes or no question, you
just flip the first two words.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,540
Is your birthday August 7th?

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,820
And then, for the final step, you just
stick when right at the beginning.

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
When is your birthday? See? Simple as
that.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,420
And now for rule number two.

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,860
This one covers all those action verbs,
words like play, study, or go.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,960
You know what? The process is almost
exactly the same.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,180
You start with your statement, you play
tennis on Sundays.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,220
Now to make it a yes-no question, you add
do at the start.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,980
Do you play tennis on Sundays? And then?
You guessed it.

33
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,940
You just pop when on the front. When do
you play tennis?

34
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,400
This pattern is incredibly useful.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,780
So here it is, the key difference, side by
side.

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,280
For B verbs, you're going to use when,
with is, or are.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
For all those action verbs, you'll use
when, with do, or does.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,680
It's kind of like a fork in the road.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Once you know which path to take for your
verb, you're totally set.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,760
So if you remember one thing, make it
this, the golden rule.

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,680
Every single when question is just the
word when plus a regular yes-no question.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
That's it.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,040
If you know how to form a yes-no question,
you can now ask any when question you
want.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
Definitely keep this little formula in
your back pocket.

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,160
All right, talk is cheap.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,840
You've learned the rules, and now it's
time to put that knowledge into action.

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Let's do a couple of quick challenges just
to make sure these ideas really stick.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
You ready? Okay, here's your first
challenge.

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,720
Unscramble these words to make a proper
question.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Now think back to our rule for B verbs.
I'll give you a second.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,480
And there's the answer. When is your
father's birthday?

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Did you see the pattern?

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,960
When plus the yes-no question is your
father's birthday.

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,480
job if you got that right. Okay, challenge
number two.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
This one has an action verb in it, play.

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,920
How would you put these words together to
make a perfect question?

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
Take a moment.

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,760
The correct answer is, when does your
brother play the violin?

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,240
And again, check out that structure, when,
followed by the yes-no question, does your

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
brother play the violin?

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,980
See, you are definitely getting the hang
of this.

62
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,840
And for our final challenge, let's match a
question to the right answer.

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,760
The question is, when is St. Valentine's
Day?

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Take a look at the options. Which one, A,
B, or C, is the best fit?

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,440
And the answer is C. It's February 14th,
so why is that the right one?

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,940
Well, the question asks for a specific
date. In April is just a month,

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,040
and on Saturdays is a repeating day.

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,220
C is the only one that gives us that exact
date. Excellent work.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,400
So now you're pretty much an expert at
asking when.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
Let's build up your toolkit for answering
those questions.

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,920
Here's some of that essential time-related
vocabulary

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,160
you're gonna need.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,360
First up, the absolute basics, the days of
the week.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
You can use these to answer questions
like, when do you play tennis?

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,160
You could say, I play tennis on Saturdays.

76
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,920
Knowing these is just fundamental for
talking about your weekly plans.

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,900
Next up in the toolkit, we have the months
of the year.

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,600
From January all the way to December,

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,120
these are what you'll use for birthdays,
holidays,

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,960
and any kind of specific date. Like, when
is your birthday?

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, it's in August. These are a must have.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,040
And finally, we've got the four seasons.
Spring, summer, fall, and you'll hear
people say autumn

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,320
too. In winter. These are perfect for
talking about bigger chunks of time. You
know, for a

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,800
question like, when are you going on
vacation? In the summer! Wow, we've
covered a lot. So let's

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,960
wrap it all up with a really simple cheat
sheet you can use to remember everything
we've talked

86
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,280
about today. And here it is, the when
cheat sheet. It's so simple. For b-verbs,
the structure

87
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,920
is when plus is R, like our example, when
is your birthday?

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,880
And for action verbs, it's when plus do
does, just like in when do you play
tennis?

89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,360
Seriously, this one slide, that's the
whole lesson in a nutshell.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,000
So there you have it. We've broken it all
down.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
We've practiced and we've reviewed.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,300
You now have the structure, the rules, and
the vocabulary.

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,600
The only question left is, what are you
going to do with it?

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,820
Now that you know how to ask, what's the
first when question you want to ask?

95
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,160
Go out there and give it a try. Thanks for
joining me today.
