1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey, everyone. Welcome. Are you ready to
unlock an English superpower?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,520
I'm talking about the power to go from meh
to wow.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,960
We're going to learn how to show big
feelings, like surprise and excitement,

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
to make your English sound way more fun
and, you know, alive.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,040
Okay, so check this out. On the left,
we've got this is a big house.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,680
It's okay, I guess. It's correct. But it's
kind of boring, right?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,760
Now, listen to the right side. What a big
house. Whoa!

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,720
Can you feel the difference? That second
one has energy.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
It's what you'd actually shout if you saw
a giant amazing castle in a movie.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
That wow feeling, that's our goal today.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,320
So, how do we get that wow factor?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
Well, let's start with our first magic
word, our first power-ups.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
And that word is, what?

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
Okay, let's begin with a super-normal,
kinda textbook-y sentence.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,240
Our starting point is, this is a beautiful
flower.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Pretty simple, right?

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
But don't worry, we're about to give it a
serious upgrade.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,040
So the next step is super easy.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,180
All you gotta do is find the describing
part, the adjective and the noun.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,800
In this case, it's a beautiful flower. Got
it?

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,080
Now just take our magic word, what, and
stick it right on the front.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,280
And boom! Just like that, you've
completely transformed the sentence.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Check it out. What a beautiful flower this
is! Did you notice that?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,160
that this is jumped all the way to the
end, that's part of the magic.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,600
You've just made a real exclamatory sense.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,640
But hang on, here's a little secret.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,340
When people are just talking, you know, in
real life,

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,380
they almost always make it shorter.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,240
They just chop off that ending part.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,480
So you'll usually just hear, what a
beautiful flower.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,520
It just sounds more natural, more full of
energy.

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
So let's break it down into a super simple
formula,

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
like a cheat code for English.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,600
It's just what, plus a or n, then an
adjective, and then a noun.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,120
That's it. What a simple formula. See what
I did there?

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,880
All right, you've mastered level one.
Ready for the next power-up?

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,240
Let's move on to our second magic word.
This one is just as cool, and it's the
word

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,000
how. Now, for this one, we're going to
start with a slightly different kind of
sentence.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Look closely. This flower is beautiful.
See how the adjective beautiful comes
after the verb

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,520
is, that's a huge clue that we're going to
use how.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
And the steps are just as easy as before.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,340
First, find your describing word. Here,
it's the adjective beautiful.

43
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,000
Then, grab our second magic word, how, and
put it right at the start.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,680
And there you go. Our new sentence is, how
beautiful this flower is.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,280
And yep, you guessed it, the subject and
verb,

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,840
this flower is, hop to the end again.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,240
You're totally getting the hang of this.

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,920
And just like our what sentences,

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,900
You can make this one shorter and sound
more natural too.

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,380
Just drop the ending and you get a
powerful, simple phrase.

51
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,160
How beautiful! You can use this for
anything.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,100
See a cool new character in an anime? How
cool!

53
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,300
See a funny cat video online? How cute!

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,660
So the formula for how is even simpler.

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,820
It's just how, plus an adjective like
beautiful

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,700
or an adverb like fast. Imagine you're
watching sports

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,020
and your favorite player makes a run. You
can yell, how fast he runs?

58
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,100
This one is super useful.

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,420
Okay, so now you've got two awesome
superpowers

60
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,180
in your pocket, what and how,

61
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,980
but that leads to the biggest, most
important question.

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,900
How do you know which one to use?

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,580
Well, don't worry, there is one secret
rule that makes it so, so easy.

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,340
All right, this is it, the big moment, the
final piece of the puzzle

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,180
that's gonna make you an expert. Are you
ready for the secret?

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,260
Seriously, it's so simple. You're gonna be
like,

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,860
Didn't anyone just tell me this before?

68
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,900
And the secret is a noun, that's it.
That's the whole secret.

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,860
All you have to do is look at the phrase

70
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,420
and ask yourself one question. Is there a
noun in here?

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,980
If you see a noun, that's your answer.
Let's look at this table.

72
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,660
It makes it super clear. For a nice car,
do you see a noun?

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,860
Yup, car, so we use what? Now look at how
cute.

74
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,460
Is there a noun right after cute? Nope, so
we use how.

75
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,460
It really is that simple. The noun is the
key to everything.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,820
Okay, you've learned the formulas. You
know the secret rule.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,980
I think it's time to put your new
superpower to the test.

78
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,620
Let's do a quick quiz. Ready? Let's go.
Okay, first question.

79
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,700
Imagine your friend shows you a new outfit

80
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,220
they're really excited about. You wanna
say, ah, a pretty dress.

81
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,100
So what goes in the blank? Look for the
secret key. Do you see a noun?

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,380
And the answer is, what? Of course, why?

83
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,260
Because we have the noun dress right
there. A noun means you use what?

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,500
You totally got it. What a smart student
you are.

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,100
All right, round two. You're watching an
action movie

86
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,700
and your favorite actor is running like
crazy.

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,180
You wanna say, blank, fast he runs. Okay,
think about it.

88
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,580
What's the word after the blank? Is fast a
noun?

89
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,940
The answer is how, awesome job. Fast isn't
a noun here.

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,780
It's describing how he runs. So no noun
means you use how. See?

91
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Once you know the secret, it's actually
really easy.

92
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,100
Before we finish, I wanna give you

93
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,760
one more super useful everyday phrase,
what a day.

94
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,340
Now what's really cool is this is kind of
like

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,260
a famous phrase in Japan, none de hida.

96
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,500
And you can use it for good days and bad
days.

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,160
Like if you got a perfect score on your
test,

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
you can say, wow, what a day.

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,260
But if you missed your bus and it started
raining,

100
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,240
you can say, uh, what a day. It all
depends on how you say it.

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,040
So there you have it. Your new superpower
is officially unlocked.

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,720
The next time you see something cool or
funny or totally surprising,

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,640
don't just keep it in your head, say it
out loud.

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,720
What an awesome video game. How delicious
this ramen is.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,960
Go out there and start describing the
amazing things you see.

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Your English is gonna sound so much more
exciting. Now go try it.
