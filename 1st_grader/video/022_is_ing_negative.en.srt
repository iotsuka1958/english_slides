1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Have you ever thought about what's not
happening?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,960
Kind of sounds like a riddle, right?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,400
Well, today we're gonna be grammar
detectives.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,360
And our mission is to figure out how to
talk about all the things

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,280
that aren't happening right now. Let's get
into it.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,760
Okay, so picture this.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,640
You text your friend who lives in America
and nothing.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
You're waiting and waiting. Are they
ignoring you? Nah, probably not.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,840
But it makes you wonder, what are they not
doing?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,360
Well, for starters, they're not looking at
their phone.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,920
We're gonna figure out exactly how to say
that and a whole lot more.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,360
So before we dive into the new stuff,
let's do a super quick warm-up.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,960
We're just gonna review something you
probably already know,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,520
which is gonna make everything else today
feel like a piece of cake.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
All right, first up, you see the sentence
here.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,920
His mother is a teacher, but what if she
isn't? How do you say that?

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,880
What's the one tiny magical word we need
to add? Think about it.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,480
Boom, there it is. His mother is not a
teacher. It's that simple.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,720
Maybe she's secretly a pop star or an
astronaut.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,880
The point is, with just that one little
word, not,

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,120
you change the whole story. Okay, you're
on a roll.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,840
Let's try another one. You are busy. How
would you make that negative?

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,220
What if you're totally free, just
relaxing? How do you say it?

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,280
You got it. You are not busy, which is
great,

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,200
because it means you have time to hang out
with me

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,860
and figure this out. See, you're already a
pro at this.

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,540
Okay, last one for our warm-up. You're
doing awesome.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,260
Let's look at this. They are students.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,780
But what if they're actually, I don't
know, spies in disguise?

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,200
How would we say they're not students?
Perfect, they are not students.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,960
I bet you're starting to see the pattern
here, right?

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,020
So here's the big simple secret. Whenever
you have a B verb, you know,

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,700
words like is, am, or are, and you want to
make it negative,

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,740
you just pop the word not right after it.

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,540
That's it, that's the whole rule. Now,
here's something you hear

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,240
all the time in America, shortcuts. We
love them.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,620
So instead of saying the full she is not,

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,900
we usually squish it together. You've got
two main ways to do it.

39
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,500
You can say she's not, or you can say she
isn't.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,260
Both are totally natural.

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,820
The only one that's a little different is
I am not.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,580
For that, we pretty much always say I'm
not. Okay, review is done.

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,220
You've totally got the B plus not thing
down.

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,300
So now let's add a little action, a little
twist.

45
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,980
We're gonna start talking about what
people are not doing.

46
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,900
Check this out. On the left, you see our
old sentence,

47
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,820
they are not students. And on the right,
we've added an action,

48
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,500
they are not studying. Now, look really
closely.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,540
Where is the word not in both of those
sentences? Hmm.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,460
Okay, are you ready for the amazing mind-
blowing secret?

51
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,600
The rule is exactly the same. It doesn't
change one bit.

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,360
You literally already know how to do this.
How cool is that?

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,820
No new rule to memorize.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,780
So here it is, the official formula.

55
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,500
For the present progressive negative, all
you do is take your B verb,

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,060
add not right after it,

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,380
and then put your action verb with ing at
the end.

58
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,560
That is the whole recipe. Okay, theory
time is over.

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,520
You know the rule, you've seen how it
works,

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,020
now it's time to actually use it.

61
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,120
Let's do a little pop quiz to lock this
in, ready?

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,240
First question, the words are all mixed
up.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
You've got playing, not, and is.

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,780
Can you put them back in the right order

65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,360
to say what John isn't doing right now? Go
for it.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,720
And the answer is, John is not playing
soccer now.

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, of course not. He's probably at
home, headset on,

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,920
yelling at the screen while playing video
games

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,400
with his friends online.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,080
That's a classic American afternoon right
there.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,720
All right, challenge number two. For
anyone who speaks Japanese,

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,320
how do we get this idea into English?

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,960
We something something doing homework now.

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,860
What two little words need to go into
those blanks? Yes, you got it.

75
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,480
We are not doing homework now.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Nope, we are doing something way more fun.
We're mastering English.

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,580
And here we go, the final boss battle of
our pop quiz.

78
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,900
The words are not, swimming are.

79
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,660
Put those puzzle pieces together and make
a sentence. You can do this.

80
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,940
And the answer is, they are not swimming
in the pool now.

81
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,180
Makes sense, right? I mean, maybe it's the
middle of winter

82
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,340
or maybe it's a school night. Who goes
swimming then?

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,660
You crushed that quiz. Well done. Okay,
you made it.

84
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,880
You did the review, you learned the new
rule, you aced the quiz.

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,080
So what's the one big idea,

86
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
The one thing you absolutely need to
remember from all this.

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,480
Let's talk about your new grammar
superpower. Here it is.

88
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,560
The most important thing to remember is
that it doesn't matter if you're saying
what

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
someone is or what someone is doing.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,520
The rule for making it negative is always,
always the same.

91
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Not goes right after the B verb.

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,560
It's one simple rule that works for
everything we talked about.

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,400
And that's a wrap. So I'll leave you with
this one last question.

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,540
Right now, this very second, what are you
not doing? Think about it.

95
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,580
You are not sleeping. You are not riding a
roller coaster.

96
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,340
You are finishing this explainer and
you're doing a great job. See?

97
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,260
You're already using it. Awesome work
today.
