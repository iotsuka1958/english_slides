1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Hey there and welcome. Do you ever get
stuck

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,460
when you're trying to ask a simple
question in English?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,620
Oh, don't worry, it happens to literally
everyone.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,860
But today I'm gonna show you one simple
trick

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,040
that will let you ask tons of questions.
And it's actually really fun.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay, let's get right into it. Are you
hungry?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,900
You probably hear this question all the
time, right?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,380
Or maybe you wanna ask it.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,060
Well, what if I told you that in just a
few minutes

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,140
you'll know exactly how to build questions

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,340
just like this one all by yourself?

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,080
Stick with me, because it is way easier
than you think. You'll see.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,360
So it all comes down to one simple move.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,880
You can think of it like a secret key that
unlocks,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
I mean, hundreds of English questions.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
Are you ready to find out what it is?

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
Okay, let's start with this simple thought
you see on the slide.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,640
English is fun. I really hope you agree
with that.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
But how do we turn this into a question?

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,720
Like, how could you ask someone if they
think it's fun?

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,320
Hmm, let's figure that out right now.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,280
And here it is, the big secret is all
about the B verb.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
This little word is small, but it is so
powerful.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
And we are about to see its big move in
action.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Honestly, this one trick changes
everything. So here's the deal.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,480
It's just a simple three-step recipe for
asking questions, super easy.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
Step one, you find the B verb.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,520
We're talking about words like am, is, or
are.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,840
Step two, you take that little verb

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,980
and just slide it all the way to the
front.

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,220
And step three, you pop a question mark
right on the end.

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,740
And that's it, that's the whole recipe.

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,780
Now hang on, here are two super important
things

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,380
that people sometimes forget, so listen
up.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,180
First, you have got to add that question
mark.

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,900
It's like the official signal that you're
asking something.

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,300
And second, when you actually say it out
loud,

38
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,260
let your voice go up a little bit at the
end.

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,020
Not are you happy, but more like are you
happy?

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,740
That little lift in your voice, it's
called intonation

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,980
and it's a real game changer. Okay, enough
talk, right?

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's put this secret to the test.

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,980
We're going to take some statements and
turn them into questions and we'll do it
together.

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,980
Just watch how our little three-step rule
works perfectly every single time.

45
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Alright, first one up.

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
Imagine you're thinking, I am late for the
movie.

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,980
According to our recipe, what's the very
first thing we have to do?

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,980
We need to find that B verb. Can you spot
it on the slide?

49
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Yes, the verb is am.

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,980
So we just move it to the front, add our
question mark, and voila!

51
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,980
Am I late for the movie? See how easy that
was?

52
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Awesome job, your first question is a
total success!

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Let's try another one. Here we have, you
are happy.

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,980
Okay, it's your turn. What's the B verb in
this sentence, and where does it need to
go?

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,980
I'll give you a second to think about it.

56
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,980
You got it. The verb is R, so it moves
right to the front, and we get, are you
happy?

57
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Excellent. See? You are really getting the
hang of this. Let's keep this going.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Okay, now what if we're talking about
somebody else? Like, she is from
Australia.

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Does our secret rule still work? You bet
it does. The rule is exactly the same for
everyone. No exceptions.

60
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Exactly. The B verb here is IS. So we just
move it to the front to ask, is she from
Australia?

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,980
Perfect. You are becoming a total pro at
this, I'm telling you.

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,220
Okay, how about one last practice round?

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,780
This time, we're talking about a group of
people.

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,300
They are good singers. You know exactly
what to do now, right?

65
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,780
What's that B-verb's big move going to be?

66
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,500
And the answer is, are they good singers?
Amazing.

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,380
We just proved that our one simple rule
works for I, you, she, and they.

68
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,700
It works for everybody. You basically have
an English superpower now.

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,540
Alright, you've seen the trick, you've
practiced it.

70
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,420
it's time for a little challenge to test
out your new superpower. Think of it like
a quick, fun game.

71
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,700
You ready to play? Here we go. Your first
challenge. Look at the words on the slide.

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,860
They're all mixed up. Can you put them in
the right order to make a question? Just
remember

73
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:14,700
the number one rule. That B verb goes
first. So, did you get it? The answer is,
is she a student?

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,820
If you figured that one out, great job.
That was a pretty good one.

75
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Okay, challenge number 2. Let's keep that
energy up. Unscramble these words into a
question.

76
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,820
We have FROM, ARE, THEY, JAPAN. You can
totally do this.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And the correct answer is...

78
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Are they from Japan? Perfect. You totally
passed the challenge. I knew you could do
it.

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,820
And that's pretty much it. You've done it.
I am officially declaring you a question
master.

80
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,100
faster. Let's just do a super quick review
to make sure this new power sticks.

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,320
So just take a look at the pattern on this
slide. Whether you're talking about
yourself

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,360
with I am, one other person with she is,
or a whole group with they are, the
pattern

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,100
is exactly the same every single time.
That b-verb, whether it's am, is, or are,
always

84
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,660
always just moves to the front. It's so
consistent.

85
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,900
So if you remember just one thing from all
of this, please let it be this. The one

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,180
One and only secret is to find that B verb
and move it right to the front of the
line.

87
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,060
That's it. See? That wasn't so bad, was
it?

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,300
In fact, it was pretty easy.

89
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,580
You now have a key that unlocks so many
new conversations in English.

90
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,340
So my final question for you is, now that
you're a question master, what question

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,940
are you going to ask first? Go on, go try
it out.
