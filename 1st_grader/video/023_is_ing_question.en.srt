1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
Hey there, super sleuths!

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,660
Get your detective gear ready, because
you've just been assigned a brand new
case.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,940
Today, we're becoming English detectives,
and our mission?

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,060
To crack the code on asking questions
about what's happening right now!

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,300
Okay, so imagine this.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,300
You're on a video call with your friend in
California.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,660
You're talking about the latest anime, and
then, all of a sudden, crash!

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,520
You hear this huge noise from their room.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,340
You gotta know what's going on, right?

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,380
What's the very first question you ask?

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,820
Let's figure out the perfect thing to say.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,180
So here's your official mission, should
you choose to accept it?

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,920
You're going to become a master of the
right now question.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,940
This is a super important detective skill
for figuring out what someone is doing at
the

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,700
exact moment you're talking to them.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,260
Now every good detective has to know their
tools, right?

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,980
So before we get any cool new gadgets,
let's do a quick check on the basic
equipment

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,780
you've already got in your investigation
kit.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,020
This should be a nice easy review.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,340
Okay, let's start with something really
simple. You are hungry.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,900
This just describes a feeling, a state of
being. Easy enough.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,620
But what if we want to ask about it?

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,460
How do we flip this from a statement into
a question?

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,980
Just like that, we just take the B verb,
in this case R, and we pop it right at the

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,980
front.

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,340
The statement, you are hungry, instantly
becomes the question, are you hungry?

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,500
You already know how to do this, see?

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,260
It's a key skill you already have in your
toolkit.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,540
So let's lock this in as rule number one
in your detective handbook.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,980
Anytime you're asking about a state of
being, you know, a condition like being
happy or

31
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,780
hungry or busy, that B-verb always moves
to the front of the line to lead the
investigation.

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,580
Got it? All right, toolkit checked. You've
got the basics down cold.

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,700
Now it's time for the really fun part, a
high-tech gadget upgrade.

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,540
Let's move on, because we're about to
unlock a new power, the ability to ask
about actions.

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,580
Now check this out. This slide shows our
new gadget in action.

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,820
Look at the left side.

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,260
The question, is she busy, asks about her
condition. It's a state.

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,600
But look over on the right. Is she
studying? Now that's different.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,260
Studying is in a state. It's an action
that's happening right now.

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,340
You see that difference? It's super
important.

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,420
So how does this new gadget work?

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,460
Well, it's a really simple three-step
formula.

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,220
First, you start with your good old
B-verb, is, am, or are.

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,260
Second, you add the subject, you know, who
you're talking about.

45
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,460
And third, here's the secret ingredient.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,940
You add the action verb, but with ing at
the end.

47
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,740
That's the whole trick. Let's try it out
with a real example.

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,700
Maybe you're texting a friend and you want
to know if their brother is free.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,180
You could just ask, is your brother
playing Splatoon? See the formula?

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,860
is, that's the B verb, plus your brother,
the subject,

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,860
plus playing, the ING verb, perfect for
asking

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,140
what's happening this very second. Or how
about this one?

53
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,960
You see your friends setting up their
phone,

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,940
they've got the ring light out and
everything,

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,640
you can ask, are you making a TikTok video
now?

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,780
It's the perfect question for that moment.

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,060
And honestly, this is how people in
America

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,980
talk and text all the time,

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,500
asking about what's going on right in
front of them. Okay, detective.

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,660
So, you've successfully asked your right
now action question.

61
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,420
Mission accomplished? Mm, not quite.

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,040
Now you need to understand the intel you
get back.

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's learn how to understand the answers.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,500
And here it is, the biggest secret of this
entire mission.

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,100
You ready for this? The way you answer
these new action questions

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,200
is exactly the same as the basic questions

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,060
you already know how to answer. No new
rules to learn.

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,980
It's like a totally free upgrade. And this
table proves it.

69
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
Look, if you ask, Is he studying?

70
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,900
The answer is just yes he is or no he
isn't.

71
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,420
If you ask are they studying? It's yes
they are or no they aren't.

72
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,780
It's the exact same pattern you already
know.

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,100
It really is a free upgrade. So cool
right?

74
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Alright Detective, you have your upgraded
gadget and you know how to decode the
intel.

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,420
There's only one thing left to do.

76
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,660
It's time for your final field test to
prove you've got the skills.

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,180
Get ready! Okay, here's your first case.

78
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,140
The words are all scrambled up, like a
secret code.

79
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,460
Can you unscramble this clue to form a
perfect right now question?

80
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,000
The words are watching, you, TV, are, now.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,700
Take a second. What's the question?

82
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,740
And the correct answer is, are you
watching TV now? Fantastic work!

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,420
You put the B verb first, then the
subject, then the ING verb.

84
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,300
Case closed. Excellent. Let's keep this
momentum going.

85
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,620
Here's your second and final case, the
clues are sleeping, John, is, now, put
them in the

86
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,940
right order. Quick, what's the question?
And you've done it again.

87
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,780
The question is, is John sleeping now?

88
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,900
You've totally mastered the formula.

89
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,940
You are officially a certified English
detective. Awesome job.

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,060
And with that, your mission is a complete
success.

91
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,820
Go ahead, give yourself a pat on the back,
Detective.

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,700
You have officially cracked the case of
the right now questions and added a
seriously

93
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,180
powerful new tool to your collection.

94
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,060
So let's go over your final mission
debrief. Key takeaway number one.

95
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,580
To ask about what's happening now, you use
that formula, bverb plus subject plus

96
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,580
verbing.

97
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,380
Two, the answers are super simple and use
the rules you already know.

98
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,420
And most importantly, remember, this isn't
just for some test, this is your key to

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,680
more natural text messages, clearer video
calls, and finally understanding what's
actually

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,020
happening in your favorite American movies
and TV shows.

101
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
Your training is complete.

102
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,580
You've got the skill, you've got the
knowledge, and you are ready for the
field.

103
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,900
So my final question to you is this.

104
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,260
Who are you going to text first to try out
your new detective powers?

105
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,700
Go on, the case is yours.
