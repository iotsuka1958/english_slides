1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey, everyone, and welcome. Have you ever
wished you could travel through time?

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,400
Well, guess what? Today, you're getting
the keys to your very own time machine.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
We're going to jump into the past and
figure out how to talk about all the cool
stuff that

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,600
happened yesterday, or last week, or even
years ago. You ready? Let's power this
thing up.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
So, you know, talking about right now is
pretty easy, right? You can just say,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,880
I am busy today. Simple. But what if the
best part of your week happened yesterday?

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
How do you tell your friends about that
awesome concert last night or why you
couldn't hang out?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
That's the secret code we're going to
crack today.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,960
And yeah, to travel to the past, you need
a time machine.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,120
But forget all that complicated sci-fi
stuff.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,080
I'm giving you the keys to your English
time machine.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,600
And the best part? It's powered by just
two super simple words.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Seriously, that's it! Okay, first things
first.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,600
Let's check out the main controls on this
time machine of ours.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
Meet, was, and were.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
These are the two magic buttons that'll
send us flying back in time.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
So think about it. For talking about
today, the present,

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,400
you've got three words you use all the
time, right? Am, is, and are. Like, I am a
student.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
He is cool. They are at school. Pretty
straightforward?

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
But get this. Here's the awesome part.
When you want to talk about the past,

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,200
you only need two words. That's it. So
your time machine actually makes English

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,160
easier. How cool is that? Forget about
three words. All you need are was and
were.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,440
So let's break down how this magic works.
Take a look. You see how m and is both
kind of merge

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:44,160
together. They become just one word, was,
and are just transforms into were. Just
two little

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,160
changes and boom, you're officially
talking about the past. Okay, so here's
the number one rule

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,680
for your time machine. It's super simple.
You use was when you're talking about just
one person or

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
thing. You know, I was tired or the pizza
was delicious. And you use were when
you're talking

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,080
to you or about more than one person. You
were right or my friends were late. See,
one versus

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,320
more than one. Alright, every good machine
needs special features. And our time
machine is no

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,280
different. What about talking about stuff
that didn't happen? Well, for that, we
have the

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Not button. Let's check it out.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,160
And you're not going to believe how easy
this is.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,600
Step one, find your time machine word, was
or were.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Step two, just stick the word not right
after it. That's literally it.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
Seriously, no other changes. So simple.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's see this thing in action.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
So you have a sentence like, he was busy.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
But maybe that's not the story you want to
tell.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
So you just pop in not and suddenly he was
not busy.

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
Same thing for they were tired.

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
it just becomes, they were not tired.
You're just changing the story of what
happened in the past.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay, pro tip time. If you want to sound
supernatural, like you hear people talk in
American movies or

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,440
on YouTube, listen up. We almost always
shorten these. So, was not becomes wasn't,
and were not

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,760
becomes weren't. Go ahead and try saying
them. They just roll off the tongue a
little easier,

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
right? Way more casual. Alright, quick
challenge for you. How would you say this
in English?

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:46,380
Got it? The answer is, I was not hungry
yesterday. Or if you're using that pro

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,860
tip, I wasn't hungry yesterday. Nice. You
totally got this. Okay, buckle up for

48
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,100
section three. This is my favorite part.
This is where you get to be a time

49
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,860
detective. You're gonna use your new
skills to ask questions and find out

50
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,380
what everyone else was up to in the past.
So how do you ask a question about

51
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,560
about the past, it's just one simple move.
It's like a secret trick.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,080
All you do is find was or were and you
just slide it all the way

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,160
to the front of the sentence. Then just
tack on a question mark.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,120
That's the whole secret. Check this out.
See how the words just flip?

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,160
A statement like, she was tired

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,720
flips into the question, was she tired?

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,200
All we did was move was to the front. Same
thing with were.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,320
You were at home becomes the question,
were you at home?

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,540
It's that easy. and answering these
questions? Oh, it's super simple.

60
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,020
You just start with yes or no,

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,340
then say who, and then use your time
machine word.

62
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,580
So if someone asks, were you busy? You can
say, yes, I was.

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,140
Or was she tired? No, she wasn't. It's a
really simple pattern.

64
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,580
Okay, Detective, one last practice round.

65
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,020
How would you ask this question in
English?

66
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,540
Think about that secret move. You got it?

67
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,420
The answer is, were they busy last night?

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,700
See, we just took were and slid it right
to the front.

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,020
You're a total pro at this now.

70
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,000
And just like that, we're at our final
section.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,660
You've learned the controls, you've
practiced your moves,

72
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,700
and now congratulations. I'm happy to
announce that you are officially

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,740
an English time traveler. So let's do a
quick recap.

74
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,860
Here's your time machine's control panel,
all in one place.

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,260
Use was for one person, use were for you,
and for more than one.

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,300
To say no, just add not right after was or
were.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,780
And to ask a question, just move was or
were to the very front.

78
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,580
That's the whole guide right there, all
you need to know.

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,340
So your journey is really just getting
started.

80
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,320
You now have this awesome power to tell
any story from your past.

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,100
So I have a question for you.

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,180
Now that you're officially a time
traveler,

83
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,460
what's the first story you're going to
tell? Think about it.

84
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,580
Thanks so much for hanging out with me
today.
