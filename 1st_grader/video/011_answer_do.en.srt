1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,520
So have you ever felt a little nervous
starting a conversation with someone new?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,920
You know that moment where you're like,
what do I even say?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,560
Well today we're going to unlock a secret
to making new friends and just having
awesome

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
chats.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,120
It's a superpower and it's hidden in two
super simple words, do and does.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,240
Think of this as your guide to becoming a
total conversation master.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,280
Let's get started. So let's try it out.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,800
I'll ask you a question right now, okay?
Do you like video games?

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
Go ahead, think about your answer.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,560
Did you think, yes I do, or maybe no I
don't? See?

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
You're already using this conversation
superpower and you probably didn't even
realize it.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,840
Now, let's break down how to use this
power to learn about pretty much anyone.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,160
You know, every great conversation, every
friendship, it all starts with one simple
thing, a question.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,440
It's seriously the easiest way to show
you're interested in someone.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,600
So let's begin our friendship quest right
now.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,080
And here's the golden rule for our
mission, the most important part.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,320
The first step is always to ask about the
other person.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
People love to talk about what they like
and what they do.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,240
It's the absolute fastest way to find
something

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,880
you both have in common.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,140
All right, it's time for level one of our
friendship quest.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,080
We're kicking things off with the most
important question of all,

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,840
asking about the person you're actually
talking to.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,800
This is where we master the classic, do
you.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,320
It's simple, it's direct, and trust me, it
works every single time.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Let's use an example. So imagine you ask
someone, do you like sushi?

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,280
If they do, they'll say, yes, I do, pretty
simple.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,600
If they don't, they'll say, no, I don't.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,920
See how the answer uses the same word you
started the question with?

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
It's like a perfect little echo, do gets
you do or don't.

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Okay, now what's really interesting here
is the difference between do not and

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,240
don't. I mean, no, I do not is totally
correct,

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,040
but it sounds a bit formal, right?

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,520
Kind of like you're writing an essay.

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,040
When you're just chatting with friends,
especially in America,

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,240
you're almost always gonna hear the
contraction, no, I don't.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,260
It's just quicker, way more casual,

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,860
and it'll make you sound supernatural.

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,400
Okay, so you've totally mastered asking
about you.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
It's time for level two.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,180
This is where conversations get really
interesting,

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,280
because you can start asking about other
people,

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,320
like your friend's brother or their
favorite teacher, anyone.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,080
And for that, we need a new magic word,
does.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,280
So let's start with a really simple
statement. He sings well.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,320
See that little S on the end of sings?
That S is the key.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
It's a signal that we're talking about

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,000
just one other person, a he or a she.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Now get ready because we're about to flip
this into a question.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,440
But watch out, here's a super common
mistake.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,360
A lot of people might say, does he sings
well?

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,680
It kind of seems logical, right? But in
English, this is a total trap.

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,680
We've gotta fix this to ask the question
the right way.

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
And here is the secret. Does he sing well?
So where did the S go?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay, think of does as a superhero.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,780
It flies in and it grabs the S from the
verb sing.

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,480
So since does is now carrying the S,

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,780
the main verb sing gets to just go back to
its simple original form.

60
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,020
Just remember this rule. When the
superhero does appears,

61
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,600
the next verb never has an S.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, to make this even easier to
remember,

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,960
let's think of it as two different teams.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,000
On the do team, we've got I, you, we, and
they.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
For anyone on that team, you use do.

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,920
But on the does team, we have the special
players, he, she, and it.

67
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,520
And this also includes any single person's
name, like John or Emily.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
For anyone on this team, you always,
always use does.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,160
And this shows a great pro tip for
sounding like a native speaker.

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,440
When you ask a question like, does John
have a bike?

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,880
The most natural answer isn't yes, John
does.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Instead, you swap the name for the
pronoun. Yes, he does.

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,160
It's such a small change,

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,720
but it makes a huge difference in how
natural you sound.

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Okay, let's broaden our conversation
skills a little more.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,880
What if you wanna ask about a whole group
of people,

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,600
like your friend's family or your favorite
band?

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,040
Well, this is where we bring back our old
friend,

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,080
Do, to ask about they. And the best part?

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,280
The pattern is exactly the same as DU.
It's super, super easy.

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
If you ask, do they sing well?

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,400
The answer is simply, yes they do, or no
they don't.

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Perfect for asking about a sports team

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,920
or, you know, your favorite singers. And
here's another quick tip.

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,200
If you're talking about two or more people
by name,

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,280
like in the question, do John and Paul
play the guitar?

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,880
In your answer, those names just become
they.

88
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
So you'd say, yes, they do.

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,080
This works for any combo of two or more
people. Simple as that.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Okay, you've learned all the skills.

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,300
So now it's time to put them to the test
with a fun little challenge.

92
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,240
We're gonna become detectives on a mission

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,240
to uncover some secrets about a girl named
Jennifer.

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,960
Let's see if we can use our do and does
skills to find the facts.

95
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,320
Okay, detectives, here is your mission
file.

96
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm gonna give you a quick moment

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
to read this paragraph about Jennifer.

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
All the clues you need are hidden right
inside. Ready?

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,040
All right, here come the questions. All
right, first question.

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,560
Look at the text, does Jennifer go to
junior high school?

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,920
Find the answer, got it? And the answer
is, yes, she does.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,040
The text says, I'm in junior high school.
Awesome start, detectives.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,560
Okay, question two, do her parents eat
meat?

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,240
Look carefully, the text says, my parents
don't eat meat.

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,120
So the answer is, no, they don't. You're
on a roll.

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,400
Question three, does she like sushi? This
one's a tasty clue.

107
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,160
She says, I also enjoy sushi. So that's a
big yes, she does.

108
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
All right, final question. Do her parents
go to Japanese restaurants?

109
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,440
The last sentence says, we often go.

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,960
And that we includes her and their
parents.

111
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,400
So the answer is, yes they do.

112
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,240
Mission complete, you totally cracked the
case. Fantastic work.

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,000
You've officially graduated from our
friendship quest.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,680
And to make sure you never forget your new
superpowers,

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,920
I've put everything together on one final
cheat sheet.

116
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,120
This is your master key for starting any
conversation.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,400
This simple little table is your master
key.

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,240
For you and they, you're on the do team.

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,040
For he and she, you're on the does team.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,680
And the golden rule, the most important
part,

121
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,040
is right there at the bottom. After do or
does, the verb is always

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
in its original simple form, no extra S.

123
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,680
That is the number one thing to remember.

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,880
So we've unlocked the secret.

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,040
You now have the keys to start a
conversation with anyone, anywhere.

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,840
All it takes is one simple question.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,880
So my final question to you is this.

128
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,680
What question will you ask someone today?

129
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,520
Go out there and start a conversation.
Thanks for tuning in.
