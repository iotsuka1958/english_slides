1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hey there, have you ever felt a little
stuck trying to ask where in English?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,960
You know, it can seem tricky, but what if
I told you it all comes down to just two
simple

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
rules?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,240
In this explainer, we're going to break
them down so you can ask where questions
perfectly

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
every single time.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,320
So let's start with a classic question
we've all asked.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,800
Where is my key?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,480
This one little question holds the secret,
no pun intended, to understanding the

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,880
whole structure.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,360
Once you get this down, you can ask pretty
much anything with confidence.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Let's dive right in.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,320
Alright, our first stop is the most common
and, honestly, the most straightforward
type

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,760
of where question.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,400
This is the rule for when you're using
what we call B verbs.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,000
So what exactly are B verbs?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,240
Well, they're words like is, are, was, and
were.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,240
The most important thing to remember is
they don't describe an action, like
running or

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
eating.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,360
Nope, they just describe a state of being,
you know, where something exists.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Let's see how this works in action.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,720
We start with a simple statement, the
answer. Your key is on the desk.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,400
First, we just take the place on the desk
and swap it with our question word, where.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,860
Now it says, your key is where, which
sounds a little weird, right?

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,460
So here's the magic step.

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,880
We move where all the way to the front and
then we just flip the subject and the
verb.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,200
So your key is becomes, is your key?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,100
And of course you gotta match the verb to
whatever you're talking about.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,660
If you're asking about one thing, like my
phone, you use is.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,420
If you're asking about more than one
thing, like your shoes, you use are.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,320
And this exact same logic works for the
past tense, too.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,860
For one thing, you'd ask where was my
phone?

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,900
And for many, where were your shoes? It's
that simple.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, so that was rule one. Pretty easy,
right?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,980
But what happens when you want to ask
where an action is happening?

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,420
Well, that brings us to our second rule,
and this one covers all those other verbs.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,540
Now, here's the big difference.

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,780
pay close attention. With a B verb, we saw
the verb itself, like is, actually moves.
But

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,420
for an action verb, like live, the verb
stays put. Instead, we have to bring in a
helper

39
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:14,420
verb, and in this case, it's do. This
little helper word is the key to this
entire structure.

40
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,860
Let's break that one down too. We'll start
with the answer again. They live in
Sydney.

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,580
Now, to turn this into a question, we
first add our helper, do, right at the
beginning.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,340
Do they live in Sydney?

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,260
Then just like before, we replace the
place with where and pop it right at the
front.

44
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,260
And we get, where do they live? Did you
see that?

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,300
The main verb, live, didn't move an inch.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,300
The helper, do, did all the heavy lefting.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,820
So how do you pick the right helper verb?
It's actually really simple.

48
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,180
For subjects like I, you, we, and they,
you're going to use do.

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,300
For a single person or thing, you know,
he, she, or it, you use does.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,340
And for anything that happened in the
past, it's always did.

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,900
Doesn't matter what the subject is, it's
always did.

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,700
Okay, so you've got the two rules, now
it's time to put them to the test.

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,420
I'll show you a few questions and your job
is to just think about what the answer
might

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,420
look like. You ready? Let's do this. First
one up.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,300
Where is Mr. Brown from? So take a look.

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,500
We see the verb IS, so we know right away
this is a BE verb question.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,620
That means the answer is going to follow
our first simple rule.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,380
Let's see what it is.

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,060
there it is. He's from the USA. You see
how the is from the question is right
there in the answer?

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,420
His is just short for he is. It's a
perfect match.

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,260
All right, next question. Where does Naomi
live? Okay, what clues are we seeing here?

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,460
We've got the helper verb does and the
action verb live. What does that tell you
about how the

63
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,460
answer should be formed? And the answer is
she lives in Narita. Now notice the
connection.

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,900
Because the question uses does, the verb
in the answer, live, gets that S on the
end.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,220
So, does live becomes lives. That's the
pattern you're looking for.

66
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,180
Let's try another one with does. Where
does this bus go?

67
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,660
Again, we can see that helper verb doing
its job. Think for a second.

68
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,700
How is that verb go going to change in the
answer?

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,700
And there we go. It goes to Chiba Station.
See? Once again, the helper does in the
question

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,180
is a signal that the answer's verb becomes
goes. It's a really consistent rule.

71
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,540
Okay, what about this one? Where does Tom
study? It's the same pattern just with a
different

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,460
action verb. What do you think? The
answer, of course, is he studies in the
library.

73
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,780
The verb study changes to studies. This
really shows how that little helper verb
does is

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,660
basically a signal for how you need to
form the answer. Last one for practice.
Let's bring

75
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,540
it all the way back to the beginning.
Where is Mary now? Which one of our two
rules are we using

76
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,780
here? And the answer is, she's in the
kitchen now. We're back to our simple
beaver rule. The

77
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,340
question uses is and the answer uses
she's, which is just she is. You totally
nailed it.

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Fantastic work. Okay, you've seen both
rules and you've aced the practice. Now
let's put it

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,580
it all together on one simple, easy-to-
read cheat sheet.

80
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,940
This chart lays out our two rules side by
side, making it super clear.

81
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,900
Up top, you've got the B verbs.

82
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,260
It's just where plus a B verb like is or
are or their past tense buddies was and

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,740
were followed by the subject.

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,940
Then down below, you've got the general
verbs.

85
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,380
It's where plus a helper like do or does
or the past tense did, then the subject

86
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,940
and then the main verb. This is your key.

87
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,160
So whether you're asking where are my
glasses or where did they play, the
formula is right

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,660
here for you.

89
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,120
So there you have it, the two simple rules
for asking where in English.

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,420
It really just comes down to one question.

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,740
Are you using a B-verb or an action verb?

92
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,060
And that leaves me with just one final
question for you.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,180
Now that you've got the rules, what's the
first where question you're going to

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,340
go ask someone today?
