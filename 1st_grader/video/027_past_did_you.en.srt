1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
Hey, what's up, everyone?

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,600
Ever want to ask your friend what they did
over the weekend?

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,560
Or maybe ask about a new anime episode you
missed? Well, to do that,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,120
you need to know how to ask questions
about the past.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,360
And today, we're gonna learn the one magic
word

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,980
that makes it super, super easy. So let me
ask you something.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,000
Did you play video games yesterday?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,520
This is exactly the kind of question we're
talking about.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,480
And trust me, in just a few minutes,
you're gonna be able to ask this

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,360
and pretty much any question about the
past, like it's nothing.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,600
Okay, but before we hop in our time
machine and go back to yesterday,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,360
let's do a super quick review of how we
ask questions about right now.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
I promise, if you get this,

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
the past 10 stuff is gonna be a piece of
cake.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,280
All right, let's start with a really
simple sense about the present.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,600
You like flowers. Okay, easy enough,
right? It's just a fact.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,520
So think about it for a second. How do we
change this into a question?

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,280
What's that little word we need to stick
right on the front?

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
Come on, you know this one.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,940
That's it, you just pop the word do at the
beginning

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,620
And boom, do you like flowers? Easy. Now
that's for you.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,300
But what about when we're talking about
someone else?

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,940
Okay, look at this one. She teaches
science.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,340
Do you hear that ES sound at the end?
Teaches.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,700
That's a little clue that something is
different.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
We can't use do here, can we? Do she
teaches?

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,540
Just sounds wrong. And here's why. For the
present tense,

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,040
you have to remember two different rules,

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Which is kind of annoying, right? You use
do for I, you, we, and they.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,120
But for he, she, or it, you gotta switch
to does.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,700
It's a bit of a headache. But I have some
amazing news for you.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,880
It is time to level up your English game.

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,540
And you know what the best part is?

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,160
This next level is actually easier. Yeah,
you heard me right.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,640
It's way simpler because for the past
tense,

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,520
there is just one magic word that does
everything.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,920
And here's the proof. In the present
tense, you're juggling two roles,

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,920
do and does. Ugh, but for the past tense,
you can forget all that.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
You only need to remember one simple word,
did. That's it.

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,540
So this brings us to the one golden rule.

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,240
This is like the secret formula that you
can use

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,440
for any question about the past, every
single time. It never changes.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,640
Here's the secret code. It's just three
easy steps.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,800
One, you always start with our magic word
did.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,520
Two, you add the subject, the person or
thing you're talking about.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,980
And three, and this part is super
important,

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,120
you add the verb in its original basic
form.

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,880
Okay, this is so important, so listen up.
Think about it like this.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
The word did is like a superhero.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
It does all the work of showing us we're
in the past.

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,300
That means the main verb gets to be lazy.

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,120
It just relaxes in its original form. So
you say, did she eat sushi?

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,820
You do not say, did she ate sushi?

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,940
Let the superhero did do the hard work for
you.

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,240
All right, so you've totally mastered
asking the question.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,660
And the good news keeps coming

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,420
because answering these questions is even
easier. Let me show you.

58
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,460
Let's just pretend someone asks you this.

59
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,300
Did you study science yesterday?

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,820
How do you give a really short, quick
answer? It's so simple.

61
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,220
If the answer is yes, you just say, yes, I
did. That's it.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,380
If it's no, you can say the full version,
No, I did not.

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,900
Or what pretty much everyone says the
shorter version. No, I didn't.

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,700
See, our magic word did is right there in
the answer too.

65
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,440
Okay, you've got the rules, you know the
secret code.

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,660
Now it's time for the really fun part.
Let's put this into action

67
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,060
and practice a little bit together.

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
All right, here's our first challenge.

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,020
The statement is, they lived in Boston.
This happened in the past.

70
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,140
Your mission, should you choose to accept
it,

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,220
is to turn this into a question. Okay,
take a second.

72
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,900
Remember the formula. Magic word first,
then the person,

73
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,060
then the original verb. What do you think?
And there it is.

74
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,560
Did they live in Boston? Perfect.

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,940
Did you see how lived went back to its
original form, live?

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,220
And by the way, this is a great
conversation starter in America.

77
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,100
Boston is one of our oldest cities.

78
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,340
So if you meet someone who lived there,
you could ask, oh really?

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,300
Did you go to a Red Sox baseball game?

80
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,420
It's a great way to make a new friend.
Okay, let's try one more.

81
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,980
This one's a little trickier, so watch
out.

82
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,700
The statement is, she wrote a letter to
him. The verb here is wrote.

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,860
That's an irregular one. And the answer
is, drumroll please.

84
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,460
Did she write a letter to him? Yes, you
nailed it.

85
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,860
See, our golden rule works perfectly,

86
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,020
even for tricky verbs like wrote.

87
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,220
The superhero did handles the past tense,

88
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,940
so wrote goes right back to its original
form, write.

89
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,760
Fantastic job, everyone.

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,500
you've just unlocked a new communication
superpower.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,120
You can now ask about literally anything
that happened in the past.

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's do a super fast recap so you never
forget.

93
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Okay, let's lock this in. First, to ask
about the past,

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,940
you always start with our magic word, did.

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,840
Second, the secret formula is always did,

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,360
plus the subject, plus the original verb.

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
Third, who does this rule work for?

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,680
Everyone, I, you, he, she, your dog,
everybody.

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,160
And finally, answering is a breeze. Yes, I
did, or no, I didn't.

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,760
You are all set. You now have the key to
unlock millions of stories

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
about last night, last week, or even last
year.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
You can ask your friends, your family,

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,020
your teachers about their lives. The power
is officially yours.

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,880
So the only question I have left for you

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,040
is what are you going to ask first?
