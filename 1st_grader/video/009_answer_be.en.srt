1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey, everyone, and welcome.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,980
Today, we're going to unlock a super
simple but really powerful secret to
making your English

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,400
conversations so much better.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,360
By the end of this, you're going to be a
pro. Let's dive in.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,640
So let's start with this question right
here. Are you hungry?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,960
Super simple, right?

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,760
And honestly, questions like this, they're
your secret key to starting a conversation

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,880
with pretty much anyone, anywhere.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,600
All right, here's our mission for today.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,920
And I want you to think of it kind of like
a video game.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,880
We're going to level up through six
different stages, and by the end, you'll
unlock that

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,000
final achievement, becoming a question
master. Ready to play?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,920
Let's go. Alright, welcome to level one,
the question magic trick.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,840
This is like the main spell for everything
we're about to learn.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,680
And trust me, it is so, so easy.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,040
Okay, so this magic trick, it's super
simple.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
You take a normal sentence, right, like he
is rich.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Step one, you just find that B verb. In
this case, it's is.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
Step two, you grab it and move it all the
way to the front.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,740
And for step three, you just pop a
question mark at the end. And boom!

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,420
Is he rich? You just turned a statement
into a question.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,260
It really does work every time. Awesome
job on level one.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,860
You've totally learned the spell.

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,740
So now, for level two, we're going to
figure out how to answer when somebody
asks you

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,580
a question. Let's keep building up those
skills.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,220
Okay, so just imagine someone walks up to
you and asks this question on the slide.

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,540
Are you from New York? So what do you say?

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,100
Well, there's a really specific but super
easy pattern you can follow.

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,500
Check it out. Here's the pattern.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,420
If your answer is yes, all you have to say
is, yes, I am. So simple.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,280
And if it's no, you can say, no, I am not,
or to sound a little more natural, you can

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,860
use the contraction and just say, no, I'm
not. It's that easy.

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,140
You've got this. Okay. Here's a super
important tip, a secret even.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,580
You know, some people try to make a
contraction like ammit, but

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,260
you gotta watch out cuz it's a total trap.

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,940
No, I ammit is just never, ever used in
English.

37
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,540
Seriously, just remember that one little
rule and

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,700
you'll sidestep that trap every single
time.

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,900
Fantastic, you have totally crushed level
two.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
Now it's time to expand your superpowers a
bit.

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,260
So for level three, we're gonna learn how
to ask questions about other people.

42
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,660
You know, your friends, your family, or
even stuff around you.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,100
Alright, this slide is basically your
guide for asking about other people.

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,660
Like if you ask, is he a baseball player?
The answer is simple.

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,180
Yes he is, or no he isn't. And guess what?

46
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,180
The patterns are pretty much the same when
you're talking about a group of people

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,860
with they or a thing with it.

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,700
And hey, for those no answers, you've got
options.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,660
You can say he's not or he isn't. Other
one is totally perfect.

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,300
You are doing so great, but are you ready?

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,760
It's time for The Boss Battle.

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,180
This is where we're going to face the
trickiest traps of all.

53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,860
Passing this proves you're a real master.

54
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,220
But don't worry, I know you can do this.

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,860
Okay, here it is, the big trap.

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,240
When someone asks, is John a teacher?

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,660
It feels really natural to just answer,
yes, John is, right?

58
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,820
But, and this is a big but.

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,260
In English, you have to replace the name
with a pronoun.

60
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,180
The correct answer is always yes, he is.

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,460
This is a super, super important rule to
remember.

62
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,700
And to help you defeat that boss, here are
your pronoun power-ups.

63
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,500
Just always remember this. A guy's name,
like John, that becomes he.

64
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,780
A girl's name, like Emily, she becomes
she.

65
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,820
If you've got two people, like George and
Peter, they become they.

66
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,940
And anything, like this book, or that
house, becomes it.

67
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,080
Cut these down, and you'll nail it every
time. You did it!

68
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,120
You defeated the boss! You've learned all
the skills!

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,660
So now it's time for the final challenge.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,260
A little pop quiz to test out your new
superpowers.

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,100
You ready for this? Alright, let's do
this.

72
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm going to read the questions you see on
the slide.

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,140
Try to answer them out loud wherever you
are.

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,860
Number one, are you from Tokyo? Number
two, is she a science teacher?

75
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
Number three, is Peter in Japan now?

76
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,180
And hey, remember that pronoun rule we
just talked about.

77
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,380
Number four, is math easy for you? And
number five, is that your car?

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,060
Okay, let's see how you did. Time to check
those answers.

79
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,740
So for number three, did you remember to
use he instead of Peter?

80
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,900
I bet you did. And for numbers four and
five, did you use it?

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,020
And hey, even if you made a little mistake
here or there, that's totally okay.

82
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,820
Seriously, the most important thing is
that you tried.

83
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,500
Practice is what makes us better. You did
a great job.

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,420
You did it, you passed the final
challenge.

85
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,500
It's official, you are a question master.

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,740
Let's take a quick victory lap

87
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,860
and just look back at everything you've
accomplished today.

88
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,540
And think of this slide as your trophy.

89
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,500
This is your ultimate cheat sheet.

90
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,940
It's got every single question and answer
pattern we went over today.

91
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,280
Keep this handy and you'll never be stuck
for an answer again.

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,420
You totally earned this. Okay, so I've got
one last question for you.

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,020
Is English fun now?

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,620
And I really hope you can use the new
skills you just learned

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,080
to answer with a big confident, yes it is.

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,020
Keep practicing with this stuff and I
promise you'll be amazed

97
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,900
at how much better your conversations get.
You did amazing work today.
