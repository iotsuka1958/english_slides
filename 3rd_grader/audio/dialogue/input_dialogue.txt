Betty loved science. She wanted to help the Earth. For her school project, she made a simple water filter. She made clean water from a dirty bottle and gave it to her classmates. Everyone was surprised. Her teacher said, “You showed us a great idea!” Betty smiled. The next day, her teacher gave Betty a science award. She was surprised and happy.
“I want to teach people how to make clean water easily.”
Science gave her not only knowledge, but a big dream, too.
