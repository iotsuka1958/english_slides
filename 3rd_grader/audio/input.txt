It was important for my cat to exercise.
She was very lazy.
It was difficult for her to run.
So she only walked to her food bowl.
It was easy for her to sleep all day.
But it was not good for her health.
One day, I bought a toy mouse.
It was fun for her to chase it!
Now, she runs around the house every day.
It is good for her to move more.
But sometimes, it is dangerous for me to walk because she jumps in front of  my feet!
