1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Have you ever been totally stumped by the
English present perfect tense?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,720
You're not alone. It can feel like a real
puzzle.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Well, in this explainer, we are going to
crack it once and for all.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,080
Okay, let's look at these two sentences.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,240
On the surface, they seem almost
identical, right?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,160
I lost my bag, and I have lost my bag.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,200
I mean, both are about losing a bag in the
past.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,000
But that tiny little word, have, it
changes everything.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,760
And it's all about what's happening right
now.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,560
So let's solve this past and present
puzzle.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,520
By the time we're done here, you won't
just understand the difference.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,640
You'll feel confident using it. First
things first, the basics.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,600
The best way to think of the present
perfect is like a bridge.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Its whole job, using have or has, plus a
past participle,

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,760
is to connect something that happened in
the past

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,600
directly to the present moment.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,120
So you see, it's not just about the past.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,400
It's about how the past affects the now.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,120
And this, right here, is the core idea you
need to get.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,360
The simple past, it talks about something

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,880
that is overdone, finished, the story's
closed.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,880
But the present perfect, that carries the
result

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,280
of that past action right into this very
moment.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,960
That's the secret sauce. All right, let's
really break down

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,360
the difference that half makes.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,800
Seeing these examples side by side is what
makes it all click.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,080
So, we're back to our original mystery.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
I lost my bag versus I have lost my bag.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's put them under the microscope.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600
Okay, so if you say I lost my bag,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,120
you're just stating a historical fact.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,040
The action of losing it is over. But
what's the situation now?

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,100
We have no idea. Maybe you found it two
minutes later.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,200
The simple past leaves the present a
complete mystery.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
But watch what happens when you add have.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
I have lost my bag is all about the
present result.

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
It means the bag is gone and here's the
key.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,320
It is still gone right now. You are
standing there without your bag.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,480
The result of that past action is still
very much alive.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's lock this concept in with another
classic example.

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,120
What's the real difference between she
went to America

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,780
and she has gone to America? If you say
she went to America,

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,120
well, that's just a piece of her life
story.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,600
She took a trip at some point. Was it last
year, 10 years ago?

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,560
Is she back home now?

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
Who knows, her current location is a total
blank.

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
But, if you say she has gone to America,

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,640
the meaning becomes crystal clear.

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,840
It means she went and as a result of that
trip, she is still there.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,440
She's not here. The consequence of her
going is her current absence.

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,720
It's all about her status right now.

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,040
Okay, now that we've nailed the result
aspect,

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
let's look at how we can get even more
precise.

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
We can use a few handy little adverbs

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
to talk about when something was
completed.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,560
These three words, just, already, and yet,

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
are like best friends to the present
perfect.

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,080
Just means something happened a moment
ago.

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
Already tells us it happened sooner than
we thought,

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
and yet is what we use for questions and
negatives,

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,640
kind of meaning up to this point.

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,800
And the grammar here is really simple.

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,160
Just and already slide in perfectly right
after have or has.

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,400
Yet, almost always hangs out at the very
end of the sentence.

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Super easy to remember. All right, time
for a quick practice run.

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,920
How would you say this idea using the
present perfect?

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,480
I finished my homework a moment ago.
Exactly.

68
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,840
I have just finished my homework.

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,880
You see, the just pops in right after have

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,520
and it emphasizes how recent it was. You
got it?

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Now for probably the most important rule
of them all.

72
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,400
If you can remember this one thing,

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,320
you'll avoid a really common mistake.

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,280
Here it is. The golden rule. Because the
present perfect is all about connecting to
now,

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,320
you can never use it with words that lock
an action in the past. I'm talking about
words like

76
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,600
yesterday, last week, or in 2010. For
instance, you just can't say,

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,520
I have lost my key yesterday. The word
yesterday acts like an anchor, pinning
that event to a

78
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,720
finished time. It breaks the bridge to the
present. So you have to use the simple
past.

79
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,640
I lost my key yesterday." And it's the
exact same idea here. Two years ago is a
specific,

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,960
finished block of time. So you must say,
she went to Italy two years ago. Never,
she has gone.

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,720
So if you see a specific pastime marker,
you know what to do. Simple past, every
time.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,240
All right, let's wrap all this up and pack
it into a simple toolkit that you can take
with you.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
So here are the four big takeaways.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Number one, it's a bridge from the past to
the present.

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Two, it's all about the results that you
feel right now.

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Three, you can use adverbs like just,
already, and yet to add detail about
completion.

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,240
And four, the big one, stay away from
specific past-time words like yesterday.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,240
So if you remember just one single thing
today, let it be this.

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,240
The present perfect is all about the now
that is a result of the then.

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,560
It's always a story about consequences.

91
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,740
And that leaves us with one final
intriguing question.

92
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,840
We know she has gone to America means
she's still there.

93
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,880
But what if someone says she has been to
America?

94
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
What does that imply?

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Well, that unlocks a whole different side
of the present perfect, but that's a story

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,640
for another time. Thanks for joining me.
