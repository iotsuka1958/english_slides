1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey everyone, ready to seriously level up
your English game?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
Today we're not just going to learn some
boring grammar rule, nope!

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,680
We are unlocking a language superpower.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,800
It's a secret tense that literally lets
you travel through time and sound way more
natural.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,640
Let's dive in and get this skill unlocked.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,560
Okay, to kick things off, let's start with
a classic mystery.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
I want you to imagine our friend Bob.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,680
See, Bob had a back, and now it's gone.
Poof, vanished into thin air.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,960
So what happened?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,400
Well, in English, the answer to that
question isn't just what you say.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,040
It's all about how you say it. So take a
look at these two sentences.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
At first glance, they look almost exactly
the same, right?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,240
I mean, it's just one tiny little extra
word. But here's the secret.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,560
That one word changes everything.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,680
It's a clue that tells us a completely
different story.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,120
Stick with me, and I promise,

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
you're going to be the detective who
solves this case every single time.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,800
So what is this secret clue? What's the
magic trick here?

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,920
Well, it's a special verb tense that I
like to call the time-traveling tense.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,120
And why do I call it that? Simple.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,640
Because it doesn't just talk about the
past.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,920
It actually builds a bridge, a bridge from
something that already happened, all the

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,560
way to this very moment, to right now.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,300
You see, the big idea here is that the
present perfect is all about connection.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,720
It connects the past to the present.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,920
You use it when something that happened
before still matters, still has an effect

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
right now.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
Think of it like this. You finished your
homework an hour ago. That's the past.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,360
But what's the result? You're free to play
video games now. See? That connection.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,520
That's what this tense is all about. And
you know what? The best part is how easy
it is to

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,040
build this time-traveling bridge. Here's
the magic formula. You just need two
little things.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,760
The word have and the past participle of a
verb. You know these words, like seen,
eaten, gone.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh, and of course, don't forget.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,960
For our friends like he, she, or our guy
Bob, we roll out the VIP version.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
Has. And that's it. Simple, right? And
check this out.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,080
This is where you can really see the
power.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,240
If I say, I have lived in London for eight
years.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,040
Just look at this timeline.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,880
It shows my life in London isn't just some
old story from the past, no way.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,200
It started way back then, eight years ago.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,520
And that line stretches all the way up to
that bright glowing now.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,280
What does that mean? It means I'm still
there.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
The story isn't finished yet.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Okay, so now that we've got the basic
power, let's see what this thing can
really do.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,000
The present perfect actually has three
main skills, three special abilities.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
I want you to think of them as three magic
doors. You ready?

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Let's open them up one by one. Alright,
door number one.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Behind it, we find the power of
continuation.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,080
This is for anything that started sometime
in the past, but is still going on, still
true

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,240
today. I know you know this feeling.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,840
It's when you say in Japanese, like maybe
you've been in the soccer club since your

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,040
first year of junior high, right? That's
this power in action.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,480
Let's look at another example with Jane.

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,560
In sentence A, it says, Jane stayed in
London two years ago.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, that's cool. A little trip, a
memory, it happened, it's over.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,820
that sentence be, Jane has stayed in
London for six years.

57
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,260
Whoa, that is a completely different life
story, isn't it?

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,980
And this visual just makes it crystal
clear.

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,920
Stayed is just a single dot on the
timeline.

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,060
A point in the past, done, finished.

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,260
But has stayed, that's a long unbroken
line

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,700
that starts six years ago and connects all
the way to,

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,100
you got it, now. It means she's still
living there today.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,380
Okay, you ready for magic door number two?
Let's do it.

65
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,420
This is the power of experience.

66
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,980
This is how you talk about your life's
highlight reel,

67
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,420
all the cool things you've done,

68
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,620
the places you've seen, the food you've
eaten,

69
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,740
from the day you were born all the way up
to right this second.

70
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,380
This is your shita koto ga aru power.

71
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,620
Think about a really great anime movie.

72
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,780
Sentence A says, I watched the movie two
years ago.

73
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,460
Okay, that just tells us when you did it.

74
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,300
but sentence B, I have watched the movie
three times.

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,540
See, that's not about when, that's about
your life's total score.

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,740
It's like your personal record.

77
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,580
And this timeline shows it perfectly.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,860
Watched is just one little event in your
past, but have watched?

79
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,540
That's like collecting achievements in a
video game.

80
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,820
You get one here, another one here, and
another one over here,

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,540
and they all add up to your total life
experience right now.

82
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,460
And that brings us to the third and final
door.

83
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,780
And listen up, because this one is super,
super important.

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,940
It's the power of result.

85
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,340
This is for when something happened in the
past, and

86
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,140
because of that one thing, everything is
different now.

87
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,900
It's that feeling of, shite shimai
mashita, where the

88
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,780
consequence of the action is the whole
point of the story.

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,340
So remember our friend Bob and his
mystery?

90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,660
Well, we can finally solve it.

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,020
If you say Bob lost his bag, well, that's
just a fact

92
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,440
From the past, maybe he found it five
minutes later, who knows, the story's
over.

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,420
But if you say Bob has lost his bag, uh-
oh, that's different.

94
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,920
The result is clear.

95
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,800
He's standing right there, right now,
probably looking super worried with no bag
in his hands.

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
The problem is happening now, mystery
solved.

97
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,660
You know, this result power is actually
all around us in real life.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,240
Let's look at a delicious example from
Japan that I'm pretty sure everybody
knows.

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,560
It explains this idea perfectly.

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
Come on, you've all seen this sign in the
summer, right?

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Hayashi Chuka Hajimemashita. Believe it or
not, this sign is secretly

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,120
a perfect English lesson. It's the present
perfect result power

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,380
hiding in plain sight. Let's break it
down. It's so simple.

104
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,840
Step one, the restaurant started making
Hayashi Chuka. When?

105
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,400
I don't know, last week, this morning?
Honestly, it doesn't matter.

106
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,480
The important part, the result for us
hungry people is step two.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,480
we can walk in and order it right now.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,220
The past action created a delicious
present reality.

109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,740
Okay, this is a fun one.

110
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,180
What do you think the American version of
this is?

111
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,860
Or like the global version? What's
something that starts in the past

112
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,860
and the awesome result is that you get to
enjoy it now. Any ideas?

113
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,740
Boom, here it is. Every single time you
open up Netflix

114
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,420
or YouTube or Disney Plus and you see that
big now streaming sign,

115
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,180
it is the exact same idea.

116
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,780
the streaming service has added a new
movie.

117
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,980
The action happened in the past and the
result,

118
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,080
you can grab some popcorn and watch it
now.

119
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,140
It's basically the entertainment version
of Cold Noodles.

120
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,460
Wow, look at how far we've come.

121
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,340
We have traveled through time, we've
solved a mystery

122
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,720
and we've even talked about delicious food
and movies.

123
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,820
So let's just do a quick final review

124
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,020
of our amazing bridge from the past to the
present.

125
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,820
Here they are, your three brand new
language superpowers.

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,660
continuation for things that are still
going on,

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,180
experience so you can talk about your
awesome life story,

128
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,860
and result for when the past totally
changes the present.

129
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,240
You've officially unlocked them all.

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,380
But listen, if you only remember one
thing,

131
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,460
one secret code from our whole mission
today,

132
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,340
make it this, the present perfect is
always,

133
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,860
always connected to now. That's it. That's
it's one and only rule.

134
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,860
It's the golden key to using it perfectly
every single time.

135
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,620
So I'm gonna leave you with a little
challenge.

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,980
What's your have done story? What amazing
video games have you played?

137
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,540
What's the best manga you have ever read?

138
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,620
Start using this time traveling tense to
talk about your own life

139
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,260
and I'm telling you, you will master it in
no time.

140
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,740
You guys did awesome today.
