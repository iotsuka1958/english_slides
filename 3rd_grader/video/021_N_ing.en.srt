1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Hey everyone and welcome.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,520
Today we're going to dive deep into one of
the most common and maybe one of the most

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,300
misunderstood parts of English, the I-N-G
word.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,620
It looks simple, right?

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,400
But trust me, it has a secret rule that,
once you know it, is going to completely
change

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,600
how you build your sentences. So let's
start with a little puzzle.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,320
Look at this sentence. The girl playing in
the yard is Jane.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,840
Now what's this sentence really about?

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
Is the main point that she's playing?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,960
Or is the main point that her name is
Jane?

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,160
You know, the core of the sentence is
actually just the girl is Jane.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,400
So what is that whole middle part, playing
in the yard, doing there?

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,480
That's the puzzle we're here to solve.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
And that's what I call the ING puzzle.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,840
It feels like these words can just move
around wherever they want in a sentence,
but they

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
can.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,200
There's a really simple, elegant rule that
tells them exactly where to go, and we're

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,500
about to break it all down.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,120
But to really get the secret, we have to
start with a quick refresher on something

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,800
we all know pretty well, adjectives.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,920
Think of this as building our foundation.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
Okay, so what's the number one rule of
adjectives? It's super simple.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,080
They describe nouns, right?

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,440
They just give us more information about a
person, a place, or a thing.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,600
Words like big, small, cute, or expensive.
Easy stuff.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,720
And here's the crucial part. Where do they
usually go?

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,240
Almost always they pop up right before the
noun they're describing.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
We say a big dog. We don't say a dog big.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,160
We say a cute cat, not a cat-cute. This
position is key.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Remember that. Alright, now for the twist.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
This is where it gets interesting.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Let's look at how that familiar ing word
can secretly have two jobs and how it can

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,600
act just like a simple adjective.

34
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,220
This slide right here basically reveals
the secret.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,040
Just follow the progression. We start
simple, the cat.

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,280
Now let's add an adjective we all know,
the cute cat.

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,320
See where cute is? Now look at step 3.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,120
We take the word sleeping and slot it into
the exact same place, thus sleeping cat.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,800
All of a sudden, that ING word is behaving
just like a regular old adjective.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Now, if you want the official grammar
term, this is called a present participle.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,640
But don't let that fancy name fool you.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,160
It has nothing to do with present tense.

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,840
It's all about an ongoing, active state.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,240
The cat is actively doing something. It's
sleeping.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,280
So a present participle is just an I-N-G
word

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,360
that's describing what a noun is doing
right now.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,840
All right, time for a quick challenge

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,960
to see if you've got this first part down.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Unscramble these words to make a correct
sentence.

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
I'll give you a second to think about it.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,680
Where does that ing word boiling need to
go?

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,680
And there you have it, boiling water is
hot.

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,320
See, just like cute cat or big dog, the
single I-N-G word boiling

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,480
comes right before the noun it's
describing,

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,160
which is water, simple enough, right?

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,640
But this leads us to the main event. If
boiling water is correct,

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,920
then why was our very first sentence, the
girl playing in the yard?

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,320
Why does the ING part sometimes come after
the noun?

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,480
Well, my friends, this is the secret rule
of position.

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,720
This slide lays out the entire secret
perfectly.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,000
It all comes down to one simple question.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,760
Is the ING word alone or did it bring some
friends?

63
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,080
If it's just one single word, like
sleeping, it goes before the noun.

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,380
But, if it has extra information with it,

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,960
it's friends, like in the sun,

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,100
then the entire group, the whole phrase,
moves to come after the noun.

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,300
One word goes before, a phrase with
friends goes after.

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,120
That's it, that's the secret. So, armed
with this new rule,

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
let's go all the way back to the
beginning.

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,720
The girl playing in the yard is Jane.

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,560
Now we have the key to unlock this thing.
So, let's break it down.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,760
The word playing isn't alone, is it? Nope,
it has friends in the yard.

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,200
And because it's a whole phrase,

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
the rule says it has to come after the
noun it's describing,

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
which is the girl. And just like that, the
puzzle is solved.

76
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,820
Okay, let's practice this new part of the
rule to make sure it sticks.

77
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,480
Unscramble these words. And as you do,
think about that ing word.

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Does speaking have any friends with it?
You got it.

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,840
Look at the boys speaking English.

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,360
The word speaking has a friend English,

81
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,520
so the whole phrase, the whole package,

82
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,200
comes after the noun it's describing, the
boys. See how that works?

83
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,440
You know, once you really get this rule of
position,

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,280
it's like you've unlocked a new grammar
superpower.

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,760
You can start building sentences

86
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,720
that are so much more descriptive and
elegant.

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
Let's do a quick final review. Okay, so
summary number one.

88
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,920
When your ING word is all by itself, just
one word,

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
it acts like a simple adjective.

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,740
And that means it goes before the noun.

91
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,140
Think the sleeping cat, the singing woman,
boiling water,

92
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,680
the rising sun, it's clean, it's direct.
And summary number two,

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,860
when your ING word brings its friends
along to the party,

94
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,120
the entire phrase moves to go after the
noun.

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Things like the boys speaking English, the
man swimming in the sea,

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,680
or the girl running with a dog.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
This is how you add all that rich detail

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,720
without getting your sentence all tangled
up.

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,440
So here's the real takeaway. This isn't
just some boring grammar rule.

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,920
It's a tool you can use to communicate
better.

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,400
Now that you know the secret of position,

102
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,440
the question is how are you gonna use it?

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,760
How many of your own sentences can you
make clearer,

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,360
more descriptive and more powerful? Go try
it out.
