1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Hey, everyone, what's up? Have you ever
wished you had a time machine?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,600
Well, guess what? In English, you totally
do.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,840
It's this really cool tense

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,360
that lets us connect the past and the
present all in one sentence.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,840
So today, we're gonna learn how to master
this time machine.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,480
Let's get started. So just think about
this for a second.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,980
How long have you known your best friend?

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,160
Or maybe how long have you been in your
favorite after-school club?

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,520
See, that all started sometime in the
past, right?

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,360
But it's still true right now.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, English has a special grammar just
for that.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,240
And that's what we're gonna dive into
today. All right, first up,

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,080
we're calling this the time machine tense.
Why?

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,360
Because that's exactly what it does.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,120
It lets us travel through time with our
words. So, what is it really?

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,640
The present perfect is basically like a
bridge.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,760
It connects something that happened in the
past

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,760
all the way to this very moment to the
present, you know?

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,760
If you say, I have studied English for
five years,

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,320
that have is the magic word that tells
everyone you're still studying.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
It's so powerful.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,200
Okay, check this out because this makes it
super clear.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,800
Look at that top timeline. Jane stayed in
London. See that little dot?

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,520
That means it happened and it's over,
finished.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,140
But now look at the bottom one. Jane has
stayed in London.

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,400
You see that long bar?

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,200
It starts in the past and goes all the way
to now.

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,520
That means she's still there. That's our
time machine in action.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,120
So cool, right? So you wanna build this
awesome machine.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,760
It's way easier than you think.

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,680
Let's take a look at the basic blueprint.
It's just three easy steps.

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,080
That's it. First, you need your subject.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,880
You know, I, you, he, she, that kind of
thing.

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Step two, add the magic engine words, have
or has.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Just remember to use has for he, she, or
it.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,600
And finally, step three, add the past
participle,

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,160
which is that third form of the verb, like
known, lived, or been.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,280
Subject, have or has, past participle.
Boom, you've built it.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,020
Okay, every cool machine needs fuel to
run, right?

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,100
Well, our time machine is no different.

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,260
To tell people exactly how long
something's been going on,

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,180
we've got two special kinds of fuel, four
and cents.

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,380
Now getting these two right is super
important,

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,820
but it's easy once you get the hang of it.
Think of it this way.

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,620
You use four when you're talking about a
length of time,

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,500
like a duration, you know, for three
years, for two hours.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,580
But you use since when you're talking
about the starting point.

48
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,500
It's like circling a date on your
calendar,

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,860
since 2020, since this morning. So four is
the amount of time,

50
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,980
and since is when it all began. All right,
pop quiz time.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,860
Let's see if you've been paying attention.
Take a look at the screen.

52
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,300
You gotta fill in two blanks in that
sentence. What do you think?

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,540
I'll give you a second.

54
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,060
And the answer is I have known him since
he was a child.

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,340
We need known because that's the past
participle.

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,860
And we use since because when he was a
child

57
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,580
is the specific starting point. Awesome
job.

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,260
Okay, you've built the machine. You've got
the fuel.

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,540
Now it's time to get in the pilot's seat.

60
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,300
Let's figure out how to ask questions

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,060
so you can learn about other people's own
time travel adventures.

62
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
Asking questions is super easy.

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,180
If you wanna ask a simple yes or no
question,

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,140
just take have or has and pop it right at
the front.

65
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,300
Like, have you known her for a long time?
And the answer is easy too.

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes I have or no I haven't. But if you
really wanna know the details,

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,900
you start with those magic words, how
long?

68
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Okay pilots, here's another challenge for
you.

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,260
Put these words in the right order to make
a question.

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,460
How would you ask someone

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,580
about how long they've been studying
Spanish. Go for it. Nailed it.

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,540
How long have you studied Spanish? You got
it.

73
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,660
You start with how long, and then the
question part. Have you studied?

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,220
Fantastic. You are now officially ready to
pilot your time machine.

75
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,580
All right, you've got your pilot's
license.

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,180
So let's take this time machine for a
spin.

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,580
We're gonna check out a quick story

78
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,100
about a girl named Yumi and her friend
Ken.

79
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,700
Pay attention to how they use the present
perfect. So here's Yumi.

80
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,300
She says, I have lived here since 2010.
See that?

81
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,500
The starting point was 2010, and she's
still living there right now.

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,260
A perfect link between the past and the
present.

83
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,780
And here she talks about her best friend
Ken.

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,980
I have known him for five years. This
time, she uses four

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,780
because she's talking about the duration,
right?

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,780
The whole period of their friendship. Now,
check this one out.

87
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Ken has had a dog since last month. Notice
how it's has had?

88
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,620
That's because Ken is a he, so we use has.

89
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,100
And when did he get the dog? Last month,
that's the starting point.

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,220
Oh no, poor Ken. It says he has been sick
since yesterday.

91
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,700
So again, we use has for Ken,

92
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,380
and since tells us his sickness started
yesterday

93
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,580
and he's still sick today.

94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,020
And finally, Yumi says, I haven't seen him
since then.

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,140
This is a perfect example of the negative.
have not becomes haven't.

96
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,540
So from yesterday until right now, she
hasn't seen him.

97
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,780
I really hope he gets better soon. Wow,
what a trip.

98
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,740
You learned how to build the time machine,

99
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,760
how to fuel it, and you even took it for a
test drive.

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,020
So let's do a super quick review of the
controls

101
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,380
for your new English superpower.

102
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,340
All right, let's look at your time
machine's dashboard one last time.

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,780
The formula is your engine. Have or has,
plus the past participle.

104
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,540
It's whole purpose to connect the past to
right now.

105
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,260
Your fuel is for to talk about a period of
time

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,620
and sense to talk about a starting point.

107
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
And of course to ask questions,

108
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,260
you just start with have, has or how long.
You got this.

109
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,020
And hey, before we go, I really want you
to remember this.

110
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,860
This grammar stuff, it's not just about
passing a test.

111
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,940
It's a real tool.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,700
It's how you tell people about the friends
you've had

113
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,740
for years or the hobbies you've loved
since you were a kid.

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,420
It's all about telling your story.

115
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,400
So my last question is for you, and I
really want you to think about it.

116
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,140
What is something that you have loved
since you were a child?

117
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,140
An anime? A sport? A video game? See?

118
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,660
Now you have the perfect way to answer
that in English.

119
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,860
Thanks so much for hanging out and
learning with me today.
