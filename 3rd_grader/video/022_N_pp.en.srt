00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey, welcome to The Explainer.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,480
Today, we're gonna put on our detective
hats

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,200
and solve this really curious grammar
puzzle,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,160
one that's hiding in plain sight.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
Okay, so every good case has to start with
a mystery, right? And ours?

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,440
Well, it's all about a simple, super
common word

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,960
that just doesn't seem to play by the
rules. So, take a look at this.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
On one side, you've got a broken toy.
Totally normal, right?

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,000
But then on the other side, a toy broken
by my brother.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
It's basically the same idea. But wait a
second. Look what happened.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,660
Our main word, broken, completely jumped
to a new spot.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,120
What's up with that? Yeah, why?

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,160
Why does it just decide to hop from before
the noun to after it?

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,400
This weird little inconsistency,

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,320
that is the exact puzzle we are gonna
solve together today.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,240
All right, so the key to cracking this
whole thing

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,200
wide open is getting to know our main
suspect.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,040
It's a special verb form and it's called
the past participle.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,760
Now to really understand our suspect,

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
You gotta look at its background, right?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,160
So most verbs have these three main forms.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,920
You've got the present, like break, then
the simple past, broke,

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,320
and then there's this third form, the past
participle,

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,460
broken, and that's the one we're zeroing
in on.

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,360
Okay, so here's the absolute crucial
point.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
A past participle, it has what we call a
passive meaning.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
This means it's not describing the noun
doing an action.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,320
Nope, it's describing an action that was
done to it.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,060
So, you know, the toy didn't break
something, It was broken.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,940
See the difference? Okay, time to check
out our first big clue.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,660
This is gonna show us what happens

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,140
when our past participle is what I like to
call a lone wolf

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,700
when it's working completely by itself.
And you know what?

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,140
The rule is so simple, it's great.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,140
When the past participle is just that one
single word,

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,740
it acts exactly like a regular adjective.

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,220
You know, like a red car or a big house.
It just pops right in there

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,340
before the noun it's describing.

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,300
And once you see it, you'll see this
pattern absolutely everywhere.

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,740
A broken toy, a used car, stolen money, a
boiled egg, see?

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,660
When that participle is flying solo, it
always comes first.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,160
It's simple. It's clean. It's super
consistent.

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,020
But our main suspect doesn't always work
alone.

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,540
Uh-uh, so let's see what happens when it
decides to bring some friends along for

45
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,920
the ride when it's part of a whole gang.
And this, right here.

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,400
This is the big twist in our mystery,
because broken isn't always a lone wolf.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,560
Sometimes it rolls up with a crew, and
that, that just changes the entire game.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,320
Okay, let's just start with a normal
example to see what I mean.

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,000
An interesting book.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,240
The adjective interesting is just one
word, right? A lone wolf.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,560
So it comes before book. That's our rule
number one in action.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Okay, now let's try that same logic with a
past participle phrase.

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,080
The main word is written, but its gang is
in English.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,640
Now, if we tried to use rule number one,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,320
we'd say something like a written in
English book.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,000
And that just sounds wrong, doesn't it?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,640
That's because the whole group, the whole
gang, has to stick together.

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,560
So, that brings us to a rule number two.

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,720
And this one is just as important as the
first.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,520
The entire descriptive phrase, that's the
participle

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,120
and all its buddies, it has to stick
together

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,400
and it has to come after the noun it's
describing.

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
and you see this pattern playing out
consistently.

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
We don't say a made in Germany car, do we?

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,840
No, we say a car made in Germany. It's not
the cooked by Helen meal,

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
it's the meal cooked by Helen. The gang
always, always follows.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
So there you have it. With just those two
simple rules,

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
we've totally cracked the case.

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,380
The mystery of the moving word, it is
officially solved.

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,540
Okay, let's lay out all the evidence.

71
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,180
The position of that past participle
really just depends on one thing.

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,080
Is it flying solo or is it with its gang?

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
If it's a lone wolf, like broken,

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,840
it acts just like a regular old adjective
and goes before the noun.

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,800
But if it's with the gang, like in made in
Germany,

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,880
the whole freight has to move to a new
spot, after the noun.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,640
It's that simple, two situations, two
rules.

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,040
And that, my friends, is the solution to
our puzzle.

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,380
And you know, this is really why this
little puzzle matters so much.

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,680
It isn't just about being grammatically
correct.

81
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,340
Getting the simple pattern down is a huge
key

82
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,520
to making your English sound way more
fluid, way more natural.

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
It's one of those little tiny details

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,800
that actually makes a massive difference.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,360
Solving this really makes you wonder,
doesn't it?

86
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,840
What other grammar puzzles are just hiding
out there in plain sight?

87
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,880
What other simple rules are just waiting

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,520
for a good detective to come along and
uncover them?
