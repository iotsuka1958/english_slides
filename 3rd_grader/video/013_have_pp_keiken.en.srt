1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Have you ever visited another country?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,040
Or, hey, have you ever seen a movie more
than once?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,400
You know, we ask questions like these all
the time,

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,760
and the secret to answering them like a
native speaker

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
is something called the present perfect
tense.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,920
Now, I know, it can sound a little tricky,

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,040
but trust me, by the end of this
explainer,

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,880
you're gonna be using it with total
confidence

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,520
to share all of your own awesome life
experiences.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,280
So, take a look at this question.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,720
Have you watched a movie three times? The
really important thing here

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,400
is that it's not asking when you watched
it.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,940
It doesn't care if it was last week or 10
years ago.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,420
It's asking if this experience is a part
of your life story right now.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,940
And that right there is the core idea of
the present perfect.

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,060
So let's break down exactly how it works.
Here's our game plan.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,700
First, we'll get the main idea, this
bridge to the present.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,140
Then we'll build the basic formula.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,220
After that, we'll learn how to count our
experiences,

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,900
master two super important words, never
and ever,

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,580
And then of course, we'll put it all into
practice.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,140
It's a simple five-step journey to get
this down.

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,340
Okay, first stop, we have to tackle

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,140
the biggest thing that trips people up.

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,980
What is the real difference between the
present perfect

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,380
and the simple past? I mean, if you've
ever gotten mixed up between

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,820
I saw and I have seen, you are definitely
not alone.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,460
So let's make this crystal clear once and
for all.

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,620
Okay, check out the difference here.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,620
On the left, I visited the tower two years
ago.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,820
That's the simple past. It's a memory, a
finished event.

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,500
It's locked in time, but look at the
right.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,880
I have visited the tower three times.

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,380
This is totally different, right? It's not
about one single moment.

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,700
It's about the total experience that you
carry with you now.

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,020
Your past actions have basically created a
fact about you today.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,820
And this is the absolute best way to think
about it.

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,140
The present perfect is a time bridge.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,420
It literally takes something you did in
the past

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,860
and connects it to who you are in the
present.

41
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,260
It says, hey, this thing that happened
before,

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,580
it's still relevant, it still matters
right now.

43
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,740
So now that we get the why, let's jump
into the how.

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,700
And the good news, the basic formula

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
for making these sentences is incredibly
simple.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,980
Let's take a look at the building blocks.

47
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,580
And that's it, I'm not kidding.

48
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,580
The entire structure is just two parts.
You take the word have or has,

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,860
and you add the past participle of the
verb. That's the whole thing.

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,180
I have seen, you have played, she has
eaten. See? Super simple.

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,940
Now there's just one tiny little exception
to remember

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
and that's when to use has.

53
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,220
You just use has for the third person
singular.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,340
So if you're talking about he, she, it

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,560
or a specific person like Bob or my
mother, you've got to use has.

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,180
For example, my mother has visited Taiwan.

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,180
For everybody else, I, you, we, they, we
just stick with have, easy.

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,620
Okay, so we've got the basic structure
down.

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,460
Now let's add some detail.

60
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,220
How do we talk about how many times we've
done something?

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,240
This is where it gets really fun for
telling stories.

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,660
When we're counting experiences,

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,420
there are a couple of special words you
just have to know.

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,020
For one time, we say once. For two times,
it's twice.

65
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,100
And here's the best part. After that, it's
a piece of cake.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,420
You just use the number plus the word
times,

67
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,940
three times, four times, a billion times.

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,860
Just remember that these words usually go

69
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,060
at the very end of the sentence.

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
So yeah, just burn this into your memory.

71
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,620
Once and twice are the two special ones.

72
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Get those down and the rest is just simple
counting.

73
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,580
It's a fantastic little shortcut to sound
way more natural.

74
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,720
Here we go, a perfect example. I have met
the singer once.

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,900
You see how it works? We've got our
formula.

76
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
Have, plus the past participle, met,

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,220
and then we just pop our frequency word
once

78
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,140
right there at the end to say how many
times.

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,140
And here's another one, putting all our
rules together.

80
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,860
My mother has visited Taiwan twice. Why
has?

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,340
Well, because my mother is third person
singular. And why twice?

82
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,540
Because it happened two times. See,
everything just clicks into place.

83
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,060
It's perfect. All right, let's level up
our game.

84
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,020
We know how to talk about things we've
done,

85
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,220
but what about things we haven't done?

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,880
Or how do we ask other people about their
experiences?

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,820
This is where two powerful little words
come into play.

88
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,140
Never and ever. This slide shows you the
two sides of the same coin.

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,220
On the left, we use never to say we have
zero experience.

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,740
I have never eaten sushi. It means not
once, not ever.

91
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,140
Then on the right, we use ever to ask a
question,

92
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,980
to ask if something has happened at any
point in someone's life.

93
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,820
Have you ever climbed a mountain? So just
to be super clear,

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,220
never is your go-to word when you wanna
say zero times.

95
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,260
You just slot it right between half and
the past participle.

96
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,340
I have never been to Paris. It's such a
strong, clear way to say

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,740
you haven't had that experience. And ever
is like a magic key.

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,300
It's the key that unlocks questions about
someone's whole life.

99
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,660
When you ask, have you ever, you're asking
about everything

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,680
from the day they were born up until this
very second.

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,440
It is the perfect tool for starting a
great conversation.

102
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,180
Okay, theory is one thing,

103
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,100
but practice is where it all starts to
stick.

104
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,820
We've built all the pieces of our new
English tool

105
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,060
and now it's time to actually use it.

106
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,100
Let's see if you can put these sentences
together. You got this.

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,460
All right, first one up. Your words are
you, have, ever, and played.

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,380
How would you arrange those to ask someone

109
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,060
if they've played the guitar? I'll give
you a second. Got it?

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,460
The correct answer is have you ever played
the guitar? Nicely done.

111
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,180
Okay, you're on a roll. Let's do the next
one.

112
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,820
This time we're asking about eating
Mexican food.

113
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,780
The words are you, have, eaten, ever. How
do they fit together?

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,020
You ready? The right question is, have you
ever eaten Mexican food?

115
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,540
Fantastic! And for our final challenge,

116
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,060
let's make a statement instead of a
question.

117
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,100
You wanna say that you have zero
experience buying a jigsaw puzzle.

118
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Your words are, never, have, I, and
bought.

119
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Go ahead and put them in order.

120
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,640
The answer is, I have never bought a
jigsaw puzzle. You nailed it.

121
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,380
So let's do a super quick recap of
everything.

122
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,360
First, remember the present perfect is
that time bridge from your past to your
present.

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,580
The formula is just have or has, plus the
past participle.

124
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,140
We count with special words, like once and
twice.

125
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,500
We say zero experience with never, and we
ask about any experience with ever.

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,820
That's the whole thing.

127
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,660
And you know, if you take just one thing
away from all this, let it be this.

128
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,740
The present perfect is so much more than
just a grammar rule from a textbook.

129
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,420
It's a tool for storytelling.

130
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,700
It's how you share the moments and
experiences that have actually shaped who
you are today.

131
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
That's how you tell the story of your
life.

132
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,460
And that brings us to a final thought for
you.

133
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,940
I want you to actually think about this
question.

134
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,980
What is one interesting thing you have
done in your life? See that?

135
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,340
You can use this grammar right now to
answer that very question.

136
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Thanks so much for joining me for this
explainer.

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,420
Now go out there and keep building your
story.
