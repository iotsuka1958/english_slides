1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hey what's up everyone and welcome. Are
you ready to crack one of the biggest,
most useful

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,880
secret codes in English? Yup, I'm talking
about numbers. You see them everywhere and
after this

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,600
you're gonna be able to say even the
craziest, biggest numbers without breaking
a sweat.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,240
Trust me, it's gonna be fun. Okay, let's
dive in. Whoa, okay let's just jump right
in with a big one,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,200
huh? Take a look at this number. If you're
thinking there is no way I can say that,

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,560
That's totally normal. But hey, here's a
little spoiler.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
That number is 20,250,717.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
And believe it or not, by the end of our
time together,

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
you'll know exactly how to say it too. You
will!

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,200
See, here's the thing.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,480
English numbers aren't just a long, random
list of words

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
you have to memorize. Not at all. They're
a system, a pattern.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
It's kind of like a secret code.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,200
So our mission today, should you choose to
accept it,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,160
is to crack that code together. piece by
piece. Ready? Let's do this.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
First things first. Every single giant
number, even that crazy one we just saw,

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,120
is built from a few tiny, simple parts.
Think of them like Legos, our building
blocks.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,680
Once you know these few little pieces, you
can build absolutely anything.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,200
And here they are, our main characters.
These are the absolute basics.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,600
Let's just say them slowly and clearly. I
want you to listen and maybe even say them
quietly

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:39,520
with me. Ready? Zero. One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
Awesome.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,440
This is your foundation. Seriously. Nail
these and you've basically won half the
bow.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Now every secret code has a couple of
rebels, right? You know, characters that
don't really

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,960
play by the rules. Well, in English
numbers, meet our two special agents.
Eleven and twelve.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,280
These two are totally unique, so you just
have to memorize them.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
But the good news?

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
These are pretty much the last weird ones
for a bit.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,400
So just lock them in your memory, 11 and
12.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,040
Okay, so you've got the basic crew.

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,260
Are you ready for the first secret rule of
our code?

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,360
This is where the fun really starts,
because this one rule is going to unlock a
whole

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,000
group of numbers for you, just like that.
Let's check it out.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,320
The first magic word is teen.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,360
You just take a number you already know,
like 4, and you snap teen onto the end.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
And boom, 14.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,600
Now pay attention here, because there are
two little exceptions.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,080
It's not 13, it's 13, and not 15, but 15.

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,800
A little weird, I know, but you can still
hear that pattern, right?

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,440
You got this. And here they are, your
whole teen toolkit.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
Let's listen for that magic sound at the
end of each one.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,640
15, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Hear that? That strong sound at the end?
That's the secret.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,220
Once you get that trick, you know all of
them. Great job!

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,300
All right, everybody, deep breath, this
next slide. This is a big one.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,680
This is maybe the most important slide in
our whole mission.

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,880
This is the number one mistake people
make, but you, you are not going to make
it.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,640
Not after this. This is the boss level.
Okay, look closely.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,900
The difference between 13 and 30, or 14
and 40, is all about stress.

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,160
It's about where you put the energy, the
punch, in the word.

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,780
For the teens, the energy is at the end.
Listen close, 13.

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,160
Hear how my voice goes up at the end? Now
listen to this, 30.

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,940
The energy is right at the start. Let's
try another one, 14, 40.

53
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,760
You hear that difference? It's huge.

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,420
So what's the one thing to remember? It's
all about the stress.

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,780
Let's do one more together. Come on, try
it with me.

56
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,220
Even if you feel a little silly, it really
helps. Say it loud, 16.

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,180
Now say 60. Yes, that's it.

58
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,560
Practicing just like that is how you
master it for good.

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,940
You are doing so great. Yes, you did it.

60
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,460
You just totally beat the boss level of
English numbers.

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,980
I'm serious, that was the hardest part.

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,260
From here on out, we're just combining the
puzzle pieces

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,620
you already know how to use to build even
bigger and cooler numbers.

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,500
Okay, building numbers from 21 to 99 is
super easy.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,580
It's like a simple two-step formula.

66
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,140
Step one, grab a T number, like 20.

67
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,220
Step two, add a single number from one to
nine, like three.

68
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,600
Stick them together and bam, 23.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,980
It works every single time, 71, 55, 89.

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,900
See, you can do all of them now. All
right, you are crushing this.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,860
So let's level up one more time. We've got
200 on the screen.

72
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,340
How do we say this one?

73
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,780
Well, this is where we hit another little
trap, a really common mistake, but one
you're about

74
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,340
to learn how to dodge like a pro.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,740
Okay, so your brain probably wants to say
200s.

76
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,500
I mean, it makes perfect sense, right?
There are two of them.

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
But hold on. That's the trap.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
It feels right, but it's actually
incorrect.

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,340
But don't you worry, the fix is super
easy.

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
And here's the super simple fix.

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,340
You just say the number, and then the word
hundred. That's it.

82
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,860
200, 800, 500.

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,180
The words hundred, thousand, and million
are kind of lazy.

84
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,900
They don't like to add an S on the end
when there's a specific number in front.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,260
Just remembering that one tip will make
your English sound so much more natural.

86
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,460
And now, look at how we just start
stacking those Legos we learned about.

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,940
For 243, you just say the first part, 200,
and then you say the next part you

88
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:52,820
already know, 43. For a big one like 4567,
you just go piece by piece. 4567. Oh, and

89
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,740
by the way, you'll hear people say and in
there like 243. That's totally cool, too.

90
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,340
You can use it or not.

91
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,240
Okay, you have been working so hard, and
you've learned all the main rules of the
code. So

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,860
as a reward, I think you've earned a
little bonus level, a fun one, where
English gets

93
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,260
It's a little silly. You've definitely
seen this number in math class.

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,120
Good old pie. But what do we do with that
little dot in the middle?

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,980
How do we say numbers that have a decimal
point?

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Okay, you're not gonna believe how easy
this is.

97
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,140
This might be the easiest rule of the
whole day.

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,940
For the dot, you just say the word point.

99
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,140
And then for the numbers that come after
it, you say them one by one.

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,700
So 3.14 becomes 3.14.

101
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,460
It's not 3.14, nope, just 3.14.

102
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,220
Super easy, right?

103
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,500
And here's where English gets a little
weird and fun.

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,380
The word for the number P-I, pi, sounds
exactly the same as the word

105
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,460
for a delicious dessert, P-I-E, pi.

106
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,740
And that is exactly why in America, March
14th, which we write as 314,

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,580
is called pi day and people celebrate by
eating pi. It's a silly joke,

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,580
but it's a great way to remember the
number. And that's it.

109
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,420
Just like that, you've done it.

110
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,420
You made it all the way through the code
book.

111
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,140
You learned the secret rules, you dodged
the tricky traps, all of it.

112
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,900
You now have the keys to say pretty much

113
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
any number you can think of in English.

114
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,940
So let's look at your final reward. So
think of this slide

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,500
as your official number master code book.
It's your quick cheat sheet

116
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,780
with all the key code words we learned
today. It's all right here.

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,740
From the basics to our special agents 11
and 12,

118
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,080
to those tricky teens and teens all the
way up to a million.

119
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,220
You know how all these parts work together
now? You totally earn this.

120
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,500
So now I've got a final challenge for you.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,780
You have the code, you know the secrets,
you have the confidence.

122
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,620
So what's the biggest, wildest, most
amazing number you can think of?

123
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,060
Go find one today and say it out loud in
English. You can do it.

124
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,460
Awesome work today. And thanks so much for
cracking the code with me.
