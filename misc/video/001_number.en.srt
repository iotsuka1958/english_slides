1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Have you ever really stopped to think
about how we say numbers in English?

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,500
I mean, it seems pretty simple on the
surface, but there's actually a hidden
code, a secret logic, right under our
noses.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,500
So today, we're going to go on a little
journey, and using this language textbook
as our guide, we're going to crack it.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's kick things off with a mystery
you've probably heard your whole life but
never really questioned.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,500
We say 14, 16, 17, so why in the world
don't we say one teen, or two teen?

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,620
It just sounds wrong, right?

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,460
Well that little bit of weirdness, that's
our first big clue that there's a system

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,460
at play here. You know, every good code
has a key.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,340
And for English numbers, the key is a
bunch of words that don't seem to follow
any pattern

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,240
at all. These are the odd ones out, the
special cases.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,140
We have to learn them first, because they
are the absolute foundation for the entire

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
system.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,660
So here they are, every single one of
these, from 0 all the way to 12, is a
totally

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,660
unique word.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,380
There's no system here, no secret to
figure out. You just have to know them.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,940
Think of these as our main characters, the
core pieces we're going to use to build
everything else.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,420
Okay, so once you've got those first 13
numbers locked in, we can finally move
past the chaos.

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,500
Because right after the number 12, the
code starts to reveal itself.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,900
We're about to find our very first real
pattern.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,460
And here it is, the first piece of the
puzzle, the suffix teen.

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,060
Now, it's not just some random ending,
it's actually an old word that literally
means

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
plus ten.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,060
So, every time you hear that teen sound,
you're basically hearing a tiny little
math equation

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,740
hidden right inside the word itself. Just
look at this.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,100
You take one of our original numbers, like
four, you tack on the teen suffix, and
boom!

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,740
You get fourteen. Four plus ten.

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,220
It's that simple, it's that predictable.
See? The code actually works!

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,820
Of course, you know, English just loves to
have its little quirks.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,880
The teen system is fantastic, but it's got
a few little exceptions that kind of show

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,480
the language's age.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,040
It's not 13, it's 13, and it's not 15,
it's 15.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,640
And with 18, we just get rid of that extra
T. They're just small spelling changes,
but

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,360
the core logic, a number plus 10, that
stays exactly the same.

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,300
So the teen suffix gets us all the way
from 13 to 19.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,480
But what happens next?

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,600
Well, the next piece of the code is
another suffix that sounds almost the
same.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
And this one little change unlocks pretty
much everything else up to 100.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Okay, this is probably the most important
part. 13 is 3 plus 10.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
But 30, that's 3 times 10.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
So one is for adding, the other is for
multiplying.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,600
That one tiny little sound shift is the
absolute key to counting all the way up to
99.

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
And once you have these t-words down,

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
building any other number is just like
stacking blocks.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,120
blocks. You just grab your 10 block, let's
say 20, and you snap one of our original
numbers

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,560
right onto the end, so 20 plus 1 gives you
21. And it just keeps on working, over and

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,680
over, 22, 35, 67, all the way up to 99.
It's the same simple repeatable pattern.
The system

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,200
is actually really elegant when you think
about it. No more memorizing, now we're

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,100
just building. Okay, so we've mastered
everything from 1 to 99.

49
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,800
But how do we get to the really big
numbers?

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,720
Well, it turns out you only need a few
more special words, and these words act
like massive

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,200
building blocks that let us scale this
whole system way, way up.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,360
The first major checkpoint after 99 is, of
course, 100.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,740
This one word opens up the ability to
build every number all the way to 999.

54
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,480
After that, the next big jump is to 1,000.

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
Can you see that comma there? That's not
just for looks.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,560
It's a visual clue telling you that you've
just hit a brand new, much more powerful
building

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
block.

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,920
And from a thousand, we take this enormous
leap all the way to one million.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,160
And honestly, that's pretty much it.

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,700
With just these few new level markers, we
can now build almost any number you can

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,360
possibly imagine. Okay, so we've gathered
all the pieces of our code.

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,280
We have our regulars, we've got our teen
and our teen rules, and we have our big

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,520
building blocks. Now it is time for the
payoff.

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Let's put our new knowledge to the test on
a really big, complicated number.

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Alright, here's our final challenge, taken
straight out of the textbook.

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
20,250,717.

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,400
I mean, that looks like a monster, right?

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,160
But now that we know the code, we can
break it down no problem.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,000
The secret is to just ignore the whole
thing at first and focus only on the
commas.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,400
They act like little walls, breaking the
number into small manageable chunks.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,200
All we have to do is read the number
inside each chunk, like 20 or 250, and
then just

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,600
say the name of that chunk's level, so
million or thousand.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,160
It's like reading three small numbers
instead of one giant one.

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,720
And there you have it, 20,250,717.

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
We did it.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
We took this massive, intimidating number
and we broke it down with the simple,
logical

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,680
rules we uncovered. The code works
perfectly.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,720
Alright, now for a fun little encore.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,280
We've pretty much mastered whole numbers,
but what about decimals?

80
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,040
And how can that lead us to a, uh,
delicious mathematical pun?

81
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Believe it or not, the rule for decimals
might be the simplest one of all.

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,040
You just say the whole number, then you
say the word point, and then you just

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,480
read out each digit one by one.

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,320
So 3.14 is never 3.14, it's always 3.14.

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,840
Easy, right?

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
And this brings us to this great little
cultural tidbit from our source material.

87
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
So the number pi starts with 3.14.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
In the US, March 14th is written as 314.

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
So naturally, it became Pi Day.

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,920
And because pi sounds exactly like pi,
it's become a fun tradition to celebrate
this

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,880
math holiday by eating, well, pi.

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,320
So what started with a strange little
question about 1 teen ended with us
cracking an

93
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
entire linguistic code.

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,520
It just goes to show you that language is
full of these amazing hidden systems, if
you

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,240
just know how to look. Which of course
leads to one final thought.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
We've just figured out the secret of
English numbers, so what incredible
patterns are just

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,200
waiting to be discovered in all the other
languages of the world?
