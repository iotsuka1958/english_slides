1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Have you ever really stopped to think about how we say numbers in English?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
I mean, it seems pretty simple on the surface, but there's actually a hidden code,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
a secret logic, right under our noses.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
So, today, we're gonna go on a little journey,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
and using this language textbook as our guide, we're gonna crack it.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,900
So, let's kick things off with a mystery you've probably heard your whole life, but never really questioned.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,900
We say fourteen, sixteen, seventeen,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,400
so why in the world don't we say one-teen?

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,700
Or two-teen?

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,400
It just sounds wrong, right?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,700
Well, that little bit of weirdness, that's our first big clue that there's a system at play here.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
You know, every good code has a key,

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,000
and for English numbers, the key is a bunch of words that don't seem to follow any pattern at all.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These are the odd ones out, the special cases.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,799
We have to learn them first, because they are the absolute foundation for the entire system.

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,799
So, here they are.

17
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,599
Every single one of these, from zero all the way to twelve, is a totally unique word.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,400
There's no system here, no secret to figure out, you just have to know them.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,699
Think of these as our main characters, the core pieces we're gonna use to build everything else.

20
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:12,500
Okay, so once you've got those first thirteen numbers locked in, we can finally move past the chaos.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,599
Because right after the number twelve, the code starts to reveal itself.

22
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,599
We're about to find our very first real pattern.

23
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,599
And here it is, the first piece of the puzzle, the suffix teen.

24
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,099
Now it's not just some random ending, it's actually an old word that literally means plus ten.

25
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:35,099
So every time you hear that teen sound, you're basically hearing a tiny little math equation hidden right inside the word itself.

26
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,599
Just look at this.

27
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,099
You take one of our original numbers, like four, you tack on the teen suffix, and boom, you get fourteen.

28
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,599
Four plus ten.

29
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,599
It's that simple, it's that predictable.

30
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,599
See, the code actually works.

31
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,599
Of course, you know, English just loves to have its little quirks.

32
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,099
The teen system is fantastic, but it's got a few little exceptions that kind of show the language's age.

33
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:03,599
It's not thirteen, it's thirteen, and it's not fifteen, it's fifteen.

34
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,599
And with eighteen, we just get rid of that extra T.

35
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,100
They're just small spelling changes, but the core logic, a number plus ten, that stays exactly the same.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
So the teen suffix gets us all the way from thirteen to nineteen.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,600
But what happens next?

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,100
Well, the next piece of the code is another suffix that sounds almost the same.

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
T-Y.

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,600
And this one little change unlocks pretty much everything else up to one hundred.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Okay, this is probably the most important part.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,100
Thirteen is three plus ten.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,100
But thirty, that's three times ten.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,100
So one is for adding, the other is for multiplying.

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,600
That one tiny little sound shift is the absolute key to counting all the way up to ninety-nine.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,100
And once you have these T words down, building any other number is just like stacking blocks.

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,100
You just grab your ten block, let's say twenty, and you snap one of our original numbers right onto the end.

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,100
So twenty plus one gives you twenty-one.

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,100
And it just keeps on working, over and over.

50
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Twenty-two, thirty-five, sixty-seven, all the way up to ninety-nine.

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
It's the same simple repeatable pattern.

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,100
The system is actually really elegant when you think about it.

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,100
No more memorizing, now we're just building.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Okay, so we've mastered everything from one to ninety-nine.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
But, how do we get to the really big numbers?

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, it turns out you only need a few more special words.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,600
And these words act like massive building blocks that let us scale this whole system way, way up.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,100
The first major checkpoint after ninety-nine is, of course, one hundred.

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,100
This one word opens up the ability to build every number all the way to nine hundred ninety-nine.

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,100
After that, the next big jump is to one thousand.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,100
And you see that comma there? That's not just for looks.

62
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,100
It's a visual clue telling you that you've just hit a brand new, much more powerful building block.

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,100
And from a thousand, we take this enormous leap all the way to one million.

64
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
And honestly, that's pretty much it.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,100
With just these few new level markers, we can now build almost any number you can possibly imagine.

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Okay, so we've gathered all the pieces of our code.

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,100
We have our irregulars, we've got our teen and our teen rules, and we have our big building blocks.

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Now it is time for the payoff.

69
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Let's put our new knowledge to the test on a really big, complicated number.

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Alright, here's our final challenge, taken straight out of the textbook.

71
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Twenty million, two hundred fifty thousand, seven hundred seventeen.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
I mean, that looks like a monster, right?

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,100
But now that we know the code, we can break it down no problem.

74
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,100
The secret is to just ignore the whole thing at first and focus only on the commas.

75
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,100
They act like little walls, breaking the number into small, manageable chunks.

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,100
All we have to do is read the number inside each chunk, like twenty or two hundred fifty,

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,100
and then just say the name of that chunk's level, so million or thousand.

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
It's like reading three small numbers instead of one giant one.

79
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
And there you have it.

80
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Twenty million, two hundred fifty thousand, seven hundred seventeen.

81
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
We did it.

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,100
We took this massive, intimidating number, and we broke it down with the simple, logical rules we uncovered.

83
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
The code works perfectly.

84
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Alright, now for a fun little encore.

85
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
We've pretty much mastered whole numbers, but what about decimals?

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,100
And how can that lead us to a, uh, delicious mathematical pun?

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Believe it or not, the rule for decimals might be the simplest one of all.

88
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,100
You just say the whole number, then you say the word point, and then you just read out each digit one by one.

89
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
So 3.14 is never 3.14.

90
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
It's always 3.14.

91
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Easy, right?

92
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
And this brings us to this great little cultural tidbit from our source material.

93
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
So, the number pi starts with 3.14.

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,100
In the US, March 14th is written as 3-14.

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
So naturally, it became Pi Day.

96
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,100
And because pi sounds exactly like pie, it's become a fun tradition to celebrate this math holiday by eating, well, pie.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:06,100
So, what started with a strange little question about one teen ended with us cracking an entire linguistic code.

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,100
It just goes to show you that language is full of these amazing hidden systems, if you just know how to look.

99
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Which, of course, leads to one final thought.

100
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
We've just figured out the secret of English numbers,

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,100
so what incredible patterns are just waiting to be discovered in all the other languages of the world?

102
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Thank you.
