Hi Jane, how is the weather today?
Hi George! It’s sunny today. I love sunny days.
Yeah, me too! Do you want to go to the park with me?
That sounds great! But the forecast says it might be cloudy later.
Okay, no problem. We can still go. If it gets cloudy, we can have coffee inside.
Sounds good!
I hope it doesn’t rain.
Don’t worry, it won’t rain today. It might be windy later, though.
Alright, I’ll bring a jacket. Let’s go!
